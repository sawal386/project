Their perception of the phenomenon, challenges and possible solutions in their views were covered. Qualitative method, particularly case study design, was used for data collection, and its interpretive approach was utilized in order to gain detailed data from the participants. In the case study, a school in Larkana was selected. Utilizing purposive sampling and criterion-based selection, ten teachers from the school were chosen as respondents to obtain data. Out of ten respondents, eight teachers eventually became part of the study, and the data was collected from them. The data collection tools were semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. The obtained data was subjected to content analysis during which different themes emerged: the establishment of an inclusive school, the role of teachers in mainstream schools to implement inclusive education in schools, and the role of the Education and Literacy Department in establishing inclusive schools. In case the mainstream school is converted into an inclusive school, the respondents were aware of the challenges that they might face and the role that they will have to play concerning differentiation, individualized type of support, and collaboration. Findings revealed that the respondents considered the school unfit for turning into an inclusive school due to missing men and material resources, overcrowded classrooms that will make it difficult to teach children with disabilities, and lack of support from local educational authorities. They recommended contextually responsive support for teachers along with their specialized training, keeping into account the real classroom environment, to successfully convert a mainstream school into an inclusive school.

      "Through my experience as a postgraduate demonstrator, I have seen that teaching and public engagement are very similar practices; both require the sharing of knowledge and experience and the realisation of benefit. These two practices are often treated as distinct, with little wisdom shared between different practitioners, despite the recent move in education towards engagement-based values. To address this, I focused on implementing pedagogical tools in a series of public engagement sessions that took place online due to COVID-19. These comprised of school talks to students considering studying science at university, with the aim of introducing them to lecture-style classes and active research. My perspectives as a postgraduate during the delivery of these sessions allowed me to identify important or obscure parts of these topics that would be relevant to my audience, and how best to introduce them. Additionally, as a postgraduate researcher, I was able to approach my audiences as a peer, rather than a ‘teacher’, and encourage more successful engagement. I used several tools such as the BOPPPS (bridge-in, objectives, pre-test, participatory learning activity, post-test, and summary) model for lesson design and took advantage of the online setting through quizzes. These were effective, resulting in an engaged audience and 94% of the students believing biophysics is an interesting area of research following the session when prior to the session 68% had not heard of it, as measured through quiz responses.\n",

This research aims to investigate whether there is a significant difference in student engagement between the use of technology-based learning and traditional learning, as well as to identify the specific dimensions of student engagement (affective, behavioral, cognitive) that is mostly influenced by technology-based learning A pre-experimental study was conducted to compare the impact of technology-based instruction and traditional instruction on student engagement among higher education students. The data was collected through questionnaires distributed before and after the intervention using technology-based learning to 29 respondents and a ttest was employed to find out the differences between pre-test and post-test. The result revealed significant differences between students’ engagement before and after the implementation of technologybased learning, implying that integrating technology into the instructional process positively influences student engagement. The most significant improvement among the three dimensions was in the affective domain. The visual and multimedia components of technology-based learning also contribute to affective engagement. Videos, simulations, and interactive activities captivate students’ attention, evoke curiosity, and create memorable learning experiences. These engaging and immersive elements stimulate positive emotions, such as enthusiasm, enjoyment, and interest, thereby enhancing affective engagement. The result implies that educators should embrace technology-based learning approaches to promote positive emotional experiences, motivation, and student engagement, ultimately leading to improved learning outcomes.\n",

However, the shifting nature of life and work in the 21st century has challenged the sufficiency of task mastery for personal and collective accomplishments. Traditional domains have been transforming; bodies of knowledge are rapidly shifting; and personal and professional tasks are increasingly ill-defined, require questioning of assumptions and goals, and involve deep value-laden dilemmas. To function constructively in such a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous world, the conception of the talented-educated person must shift. In this presentation, we use the Dynamic Systems Model of Role Identity—an integrative complex dynamic systems model of identity, motivation, and action—to propose desirable characteristics of 21st century identities as centered on agency and skills in identity exploration. In this conception, learning goes beyond knowledge to reflect identity change, and self-regulated learning goes beyond pursuit of success in predetermined tasks to reflect proactive identity exploration. In this conception, learning goes beyond knowledge to reflect identity change, and self-regulated learning goes beyond pursuit of success in predetermined tasks to reflect proactive engagement in exploring and forming one’s identity to influence contextual change in light of core values.

It is considered in much of the distance education literature to be a robust collaborative-constructivist process model that uses three essential elements to interpret educational experience: cognitive presence, teaching presence, and social presence. Widespread use of the CoI framework has resulted in several criticisms, such as having no guidelines for implementation, no incorporation of assessment and evaluation metrics, and no widespread consensus on the current model’s ability to represent all the contributing factors that promote a positive educational experience. However, there is an opportunity to overcome these shortcomings, some of which may exist, and to use the CoI’s extraordinary strength in creating a positive education experience, by adding instructional design effectiveness. The purpose of this combination of a literature review and opinion is to present the CoI framework and its major controversies to shine a light on its importance as one approach to designing critical parts of e-learning. Additionally, given the CoI’s purpose of creating a positive educational experience, this paper argues to make explicit to instructional designers and instructors the need to address using the CoI framework within an effective overall design.\n",

      "Finding out more about the connection among various teachers\\' beliefs about information and communication technology (ICT) integration will assist teachers in achieving successful integration of technology and enhance the quality of the teaching and learning process. This study examined the connection among various beliefs of English as foreign language (EFL) teachers in integrating ICT. Using a descriptive case study, three elementary-level EFL teachers\\' beliefs about ICT were investigated based on their positive beliefs, self-efficacy beliefs, and pedagogical beliefs. Data collection employed questionnaires and interviews. The teachers\\' beliefs were analyzed by using theory from Taimalu and Luik (2019). Meanwhile, Johnson\\'s (1992) framework is adopted to examine pedagogical beliefs, particularly content-specific pedagogical beliefs. The framework was chosen to focus specifically on English subjects. The result showed that there was inconsistency among teachers\\' beliefs. Some teachers who had positive beliefs about ICT were lack of self-efficacy and pedagogical beliefs. In content-specific pedagogical beliefs, they had beliefs that ICT integration was appropriate for teaching English skill-based and function-based. Moreover, some teachers with low self-efficacy perceived complexity in use, new technologies, and internet connection as barriers to their self-efficacy beliefs in integrating ICT into the class.\n",

This study examined the effect of parents’ education level on their participation in management of learners’ discipline in public day secondary schools in Kitui County, Kenya. The hypothesis was: there is no relationship between parents’ level of education and their engagement in management of student discipline. Descriptive survey design was adopted. The sample included 70 public day secondary schools, 70 Principals, 70 Parents’ Teachers’ Association (PTA) chairpersons, 86 Form three class teachers and 354 Form three students obtained by purposive sampling, simple random sampling and stratified proportionate sampling. The instruments were questionnaires, interview guide and focus group discussions. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The significance level was set at alpha = 0.05. Pearson’s correlation coefficient test results indicated a strong positive correlation (r=0.714, P &lt; 0.05) hence the hypothesis was rejected and conclusion was made that parental education level affects management of students’ discipline since parents with low level of educational attainment were less engaged. Recommendations were made that: The school board of management could organize workshops to equip parents with skills on parental engagement, the Ministry of Education could establish a policy on parental home supervision. The Teachers Service Commission could organize in-service training programs to equip teachers with skills for sensitizing parents on parental engagement.

Even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, many education systems remained inequitable and either excluded children with the most complex disabilities or lacked quality in implementation. The Perkins Quality Indicators (PQIs) provide a metric to measure and assess programs that serve children with complex disabilities by identifying current good practices and areas for improvement. Program staff may use the PQIs for self-reflection, evaluation and planning. The tool may also be used by program administrators and external evaluators, in collaboration with program staff. The PQIs address 9 program areas: building community/ inclusive culture, program planning and classroom organization, learning environment and materials, communication and social relationships, assessment and progress monitoring, curriculum and instruction, family support, administration and support, and governmental collaborations. We aim to present the PQIs as a practical tool that can be used to support and document growth of quality programs over time through the development of priorities for both teacher professional development and school-based development, at individual, local, district, division, regional, and national levels. The PQIs have been implemented in at least 17 countries across 4 continents, including in the Philippines; we will present a representative case study of implementation in the Philippines to demonstrate how the PQIs help to create a roadmap for programs to achieve excellence and accelerate progress. We conclude that the implementation of the PQIs in settings that serve children and youth with complex disabilities has great potential for making measurable improvements in the quality of these programs, accelerating progress toward the global goals of more equitable education, especially after learning setbacks caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n",

      "This chapter explores challenges facing Early Childhood Care and Education in rural areas of Botswana. Issues that are analysed in the chapter are derived from secondary sources such as journals, books and unpublished sources such as students’ research projects and newspapers. Early childhood care and education (ECCE), which addresses the period from birth to 8 years old, is important because it capitalizes on a period of rich brain development for children and, when it is of good quality, can help them achieve their full potential. It can lay the foundation for good health and nutrition, learning and educational success, social-emotional learning, and economic productivity throughout life. Despite the evidence for these social, human and economic developmental gains, it is still often given low priority in education policy and investment and, where it does exist, may exclude marginalized groups. ECCE has its own extra vulnerability in that much of it is privately provided. Quality Early Childhood Care and Education programs are beneficial to children in numerous ways. Consequently, from time immemorial, various stakeholders not only in Botswana, but the world over, have embarked on various efforts to try to provide such services. However, several challenges in the provision of Early Childhood Care and Education services prevail in various countries. The chapter discusses such issues in the context of Botswana. These include: low access to ECCE services; funding constraints; nutritional challenges; gender disparity in the provision of ECCE services; shortage of trained and qualified teachers and low compensation as well as high staff turnover. The chapter also maps the way forward in relation to addressing the challenges. Among the recommendations made toward mitigating the current challenges are: the Government should assume leadership in the provision of ECCE services; improvements in the nutritional value of meals that are given to pre-schoolers, as well as the need to address gender disparities in ECCE.\n",

      "Curriculum leadership in its entirety plays a vital role in academic achievement in educational institutions. However, majority of studies show that administrators have insignificant impact on learners’ academic achievement. This is not the case since school principals are curriculum leaders and are responsible for learners’ performance in many ways. This study investigated the influence of curriculum leadership on learners\\' academic achievement in public day secondary schools in Chesumei Sub-County, Kenya. The research focused on two specific objectives: (1) examining the influence of teacher preparation for instruction on students\\' academic achievements and (2) exploring the influence of educational resources’ provision on students\\' academic achievement The study drew theoretical inspiration from Fielder\\'s contingency theory, which posits that a leader\\'s efficacy is determined by the alignment between their dominant traits and the situational context.

      "Introduction: According to South Africa\\'s key education policies, all children can learn and need support, necessitating collaboration between occupational therapists and educators. Collaboration between occupational therapists and educators within the classroom is however a relatively new practice in South Africa and there is a dearth of literature that report on studies in this regard. The aim of this study was thus to explore occupational therapists\\' and educators\\' experiences in adopting a classroom approach in three primary mainstream schools in the Metro North education district in the Western Cape. Methodology: A qualitative research approach andexploratory descriptive design was utilised. Data collection included semi-structured interviews and focus groups with educators and occupational therapists who participated in the curriculum of support in the classroom programme. Thematic data analysis was conducted. Findings: Three themes highlighting the meaning and value the participants assigned to classroom collaboration, andfactors that facilitate or limit the implementation of the curriculum of support emerged from the analysis. Conclusion: The study is useful in expanding the understanding of the changing role of occupational therapists within the context of inclusive education and contributes to the development of educator support strategies utilising the whole classroom approach. This approach entails the educator and occupational therapist working together in implementing activities in the classroom to all learners. These learning activities are based on curriculum themes and occupational therapy principles and components. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Occupational therapists\\' roles in the education practice context are expanding from traditionally working in special school settings to providing support to educators within public mainstream schools. The role of the occupational therapist within public mainstream schools is evolving from a consultative role and providing input into the individual support of learners to providing hands-on support to educators and collaborating with them within the classroom.\n",

      "Learning is a process that takes place within an individual, transforming their behavior in terms of thinking, attitudes, and actions. Education is the process of transferring knowledge involving various elements in the educational system, namely: the teacher/educator, learners, materials, objectives, and tools. Planned or accompanied learning must be effective and efficient so that the learning objectives are achieved and well-received by the learners, contributing to the successful attainment of national educational goals. In response to the evolving education landscape and system in Indonesia, all elements of society, particularly those directly involved in the education profession, are required to be more creative and professional in developing education. Additionally, educational practitioners are expected to adhere to established procedures in accordance with the needs and challenges of education. Due to the complexity and challenges of the present era, there has been a shift in the orientation of education globally, influencing the educational orientation in Indonesia. Education oriented toward procedural mastery is no longer relevant to the challenges of the current era. The change in educational orientation in Indonesia is marked by a shift in curriculum paradigms, such as the emergence of constructivist curriculum systems like Curriculum 2013 and Merdeka Curriculum. This research adopts a qualitative descriptive approach to identify, collect, and analyze data regarding the use of the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) design model. Data is collected through observation, interviews, and documentation, and the analysis is carried out using data reduction techniques. The findings indicate the development of self-potential in achieving the goals of Islamic religious education. Therefore, educators in Indonesia need to reconstruct their understanding of learning, teaching, and instructional design to align with the constructivist paradigm, enabling the planning of education that is in line with the educational orientation in Indonesia.\n",

      "This paper engages with literature on flexible learning and teaching in order to explore whether it may be possible, within the South African context, to have flexible learning and teaching provide a third way which goes beyond the current practice of full-time/part-time provision. This binary classification of students is a proxy for day-time/after-hours delivery.&nbsp; The argument is made that effective, flexible learning and teaching requires a fundamental shift in thinking about learning and teaching in higher education that moves us beyond such binaries. The paper proposes that in order to ensure access and success for students, \\'common knowledge\\' (Edwards, 2010) will need to be co-constructed which understands flexible learning and teaching in ways which will meet needs of a diversity of students, including working students. It will require \\'resourceful leadership\\' (Edwards, 2014) within the university that recognises, enhances and gives purpose to the capability of colleagues at every level of the systems they lead. Also, it will require the building of \\'common knowledge\\' between certain sectors of universities and particular workplaces.\n",

      "The deterministic tradition abides by the principles of intuitionistic logic, in which the current state of all systems is determined by prior versions of what they are. Systemic determinism, where the present simultaneously substantiates pre-existing conditions and predicts imminent realities, has long championed the logic of the natural sciences, providing substance and legitimacy for an infallible cause-effect agency. Advocacy for deterministic agency is well sensed in the organization and administration of education. Many educational reforms are conceived with practices that espouse the logic of linear progression. The intent of this paper is to interrogate the legitimacy of the deterministic approach to educational reform in Morocco against its capacity to predict change. In particular, the outputs from five educational reforms carried out in Morocco over the 1999-2022 period were subjected to content analysis for obtaining data on the statistical distribution of changes in relation to three research dimensions: access to primary education, adult literacy and gender equality . In a later stage, the outputs from the quantitative analysis were optimized to enable inferential modes of analysis. The findings from this study revealed that systemic determinism is incapacitated by the principle of cause-effect agency that hyperbolizes the influences of the past on the imperatives of the present. &nbsp; Received: 25 October 2022 / Accepted: 24 February 2022 / Published: 6 March 2023\n",

The research aims to identify similarities, differences, and areas for potential convergence or divergence in curricular approaches, content, and implementation strategies. Employing a qualitative multiple case study design, the study examines key curriculum documents, policy papers, and official reports from the respective ministries of education. Additionally, semi-structured interviews with educational stakeholders, including policymakers, curriculum developers, teachers, and experts, are conducted to capture diverse perspectives. The findings reveal both commonalities and significant differences in the overall guiding principles, subject matter prioritization, instructional methods, assessment strategies, and the integration of technology, multicultural perspectives, and moral/ethical values across the curricula. While shared goals, such as developing critical thinking and lifelong learning skills, are evident, the specific curricular approaches reflect the unique historical, cultural, and political contexts of each country or region. The study highlights the strong emphasis on competency-based learning and the development of core competencies in the Turkish curriculum, contrasting with the advanced technology integration strategies observed in certain EU countries. Additionally, the analysis reveals a greater emphasis on multicultural and inclusive education in some EU curricula, while the Turkish curriculum exhibits a more explicit integration of moral and ethical values rooted in Islamic traditions. The research identifies challenges related to teacher training, resource availability, and community engagement in curriculum implementation across both Turkish and EU contexts. The findings contribute to the broader discourse on curriculum development, educational reform, and the potential for cross-national learning and collaboration. The study underscores the importance of ongoing dialogue, knowledge-sharing, and collaborative efforts in shaping educational systems that are responsive to the diverse needs of learners and societies in an increasingly interconnected world.\n",

The covered a sample of 300 respondents drawn from a target population of 1400 students of secondary schools in Iringa Municipality. Data analysis was done by use of descriptive and inferential statistics; frequencies, percentages, correlation, and multiple regression. The study revealed that; social influence, social media, and civic education have a positive but weak relationship with youth participation in leadership in secondary schools in Iringa Municipality. This is because the correlation coefficients (r) on the relationship between social influence, social media and civic education with youth leadership participation were 0.159, 0.139, and 0.099 respectively which shows positive significance but weak. This is because in estimating the required relationship the results yielded p values greater than 0.05 which justify insignificant contributions. The practical implication is that these constructs should be improved in their application in order to provide a significant contribution to youth leadership in Iringa Municipality. Based on these results, the researcher recommends advanced policies and division of resources to address youth marginalization in the distribution of opportunities for leadership participation. The resources to be addressed should cover both financial and non-financial resources.

Effective classroom management is not only beneficial to teaching efficiency, but also conducive to the comprehensive development of the students. This paper aims to explore effective strategies of managing English classrooms for secondary school learners. Using a foreign language in the classroom may impede classroom management, as code-switching in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms may induce stress and discomfort among students. Long-term issues with the English subject compound over time, impacting learning outcomes and eroding students\\' confidence. But autonomous students are more likely to take the initiative to learn and explore outside the classroom. Generally, creating a classroom environment suitable for secondary school students is one of the main responsibilities of teachers.

Data analysis is carried out through data reduction, data presentation, and conclusions. The results showed that the subject teachers Indonesian MAN 2 Ponorogo carried out lesson planning well. They compile learning tools such as lesson plans, syllabi, semester programs, and annual programs. In addition, the implementation of learning Indonesian carried out in a structured manner according to learning tools or lesson plans. The learning process starts from the initial activity, core activities, to the final or closing activities of the lesson. Learning evaluation Indonesian carried out before the learning activity process takes place. The pre-test assessment procedure involves oral tests, formative tests, and summative tests. This indicates an effort to evaluate students\\' understanding and abilities before learning begins. Overall, this study concludes that Indonesian learning management in MAN 2 Ponorogo has been done well. Subject teachers Indonesian have carried out planning, implementation, and evaluation of learning in a structured manner. However, there needs to be further development in terms of assessment during the learning process.\n",

      "The fourth revolution of industrialization has enormously influenced the education sector and needs to be dynamic and sensible in light of the changeable requirements of employers. Specifically, higher education institutions (HEIs) must focus on the global labor market to offer an innovative curriculum and attract prospective students. One of the current trends in the higher education sector is to design interdisciplinary degree programs. The interdisciplinary master\\'s degree program is relatively new in Mongolian tertiary education. Therefore, we aimed to identify the need for a master’s degree program in interdisciplinary studies in education from the perspective of prospective students and also determine the areas of studies that have been preferred in the field of education. In this study, two online surveys and a focused-group interview were conducted. Three hundred ten educators were involved in the online surveys and focused-group interviews. The research questions were created on Google form, data was collected electronically, and focused group interviews were conducted simultaneously. The findings indicated that 52% of the prospective students preferred a master’s degree program in interdisciplinary studies in education, and a diverse combination of areas has been demanded, in particular, education and modern teaching methodology (26.4%); teaching and linguistics (25.5%); education and international studies (23%) and, teaching and psychology (19.4%). The other important finding was that interdisciplinary studies would be able to provide the necessary knowledge and skills that make graduates competitive in the labor market.\n",

      "In Education, teachers must have interesting ideas to make students interested in learning English in reading skills. The success of students learning English in reading skills depends on the ability of students. If the students’ ability is very low, it is likely that they will experience difficulties in receiving lessons or students will most likely fail in learning. Conversely, if students have good reading skills, they have the opportunity to succeed in their studies. The researcher asked several questions to the English teacher, from the answers given there were several problems that occurred, the problem that really stood out was the lack of students\\' understanding in reading the text, not just students\\' motivation in reading English texts. To overcome this problem researcher used the Buzz Group Technique. The advantage of the Buzz Group Technique helps students to be able to convey ideas or opinions in groups and encourages students to participate in discussions. The purpose of this study was to improve students\\' reading skills. Then this research used classroom action research, which is a teaching activity where they can provide quality education by involving action, evaluation, and reflection based on the evidence collected, in order to improve educational practice. After carrying out the learning activities the researcher obtained data from the results of the pre-test cycle I and cycle 2 increased. In the pre-test 11.77% of students achieved KKM. In cycle 1 47.06% of students achieved KKM. and in cycle II 76.47% of students achieved KKM. This research is expected to assist teachers in teaching and preparing good and appropriate practice tests for the learning process, and can also be used as motivation in improving skills in reading texts and can make students more productive in understanding the meaning of the contents of the text reading text.\n",

      "The fast-paced and ever-changing modern world is witnessing the onset of a novel era of teaching methods, which often combine elements of traditional approaches such as reductionism and holism while providing prospects for fresh discourse, ideas, and outlooks. This paper aims to explain how perspectives on how education is understood have changed throughout time until complexity thinking emerged in more recent decades (Jacobson &amp; Wilensky, 2022; Morin, 1992, 2011). In pursuit of this goal, the main characteristics of reductionism, holism, and systemic thinking are discussed, as well as how such transformations in perspectives have influenced the emergence of complexity thinking. As explained by Davis et al. (2015), complexity thinking started to spread among educational researchers not as a way of superimposing previous theories, but to present new points of view and possibilities instead. Complexity thinking in education is innovative as it goes against previous beliefs that learning occurs in linear ways, meaning that it recognizes and deals with conflict, uncertainty, and disharmony in learning processes. According to Jacobson and Wilensky (2022), educational researchers should continue to explore innovative pedagogies and technologies that embrace complexity, bringing crucial contributions to theories of teaching and learning.\n",

      "Following the policy of New Normal in the post Covid-19 Pandemic, the Indonesian government has begun introducing blended learning activities. Because of this policy, teachers have been encouraged to establish a plan for using blended learning that is aligned with the learning interests of the students. Therefore, the emphasis of this research was on the technique that the teacher and school administration employed in order to improve the English language education system after the COVID-19 outbreak.&nbsp; The purpose of this study was to provide a description of the approach taken by English teachers following the establishment of the new normal in the time period following the Covid-19 Pandemic. A descriptive qualitative methodology was utilized for this investigation. Participants in the study were English teachers working at SMAX, SMAY, and SMAZ schools located in Mataram City. In this particular study, the methods of data collecting that were utilized were observation, interviews, and documentation. According to the findings of the study, educators devised a variety of instructional methods in order to deal with the challenges posed by blended learning modes, which placed equal emphasis on synchronous and asynchronous learning. The findings of the research answered well the guiding research questions. The study concludes that teachers encountered significant challenges when utilizing asynchronous learning mode. The challenges arose as a consequence of insufficient student involvement as well as inadequate assistance for internet connection. As a result of the decreased amount of time allotted for learning, it was discovered that certain teachers struggle with managing their time effectively.\n",

      "Motivation is an effective tool to encourage teachers in teaching and learning. Motivation is defined as the arousal of behaviours which is directed towards a particular goal. The teachers who are the instructors and knowledge imparters, should be made happy in order to put in their best in teaching and impartation of knowledge to students. Therefore, this study investigated those things which can make teachers happy and motivated in doing their duties. The research work was carried out in Anambra State public secondary schools. Two research questions and one hypothesis guided the study. All the 256 principals and 1,500 teachers constituted the population. 1,500 teachers were selected using stratified random research design out of 6,233 teachers in the state public secondary schools in the six educational zones in the state. The two research questions were gathered using mean and standard deviation while t-test was used in testing the hypothesis at 0.05 level of significance. The result showed that teachers are not well motivated e.g. they were not paid as and when due, no additional incentives, not involved in decision making etc. Therefore it was recommended that both the government and principals should look into those things that would motivate teachers in order to achieve the core objectives of establishing a school which is teaching and learning. E.g. paying as and when due, giving the freedom to acquire more training, provision of accommodation etc.\n",

      "Project-based learning (PjBL) is a teaching and learning approach that involves students actively working on real-world projects, to develop knowledge and skills. This method has been shown to be effective in promoting learner autonomy (LA) and skills development in language learning studies. There is, however, a dearth of research on the use of PjBL in hospitality education, especially in a technical and vocational education and training (TVET) environment. Using a case study research strategy, this study aimed to investigate whether PjBL could be used to promote autonomy and develop employable skills in students in hospitality education. A convergent mixed methods approach was used to develop a framework for PjBL in promoting LA in a TVET environment. The study included a closed-structured questionnaire with responses from 144 (n=144) students from two hospitality programmes, as well as a semi-structured interview with 18 student participants. The findings indicate that PjBL is an effective teaching and learning approach in hospitality education that can promote LA, lead to a deeper understanding of the subject matter, while facilitating the development of a variety of important skills and competencies. Students can apply their knowledge and skills in meaningful ways through hands-on, real-world activities, which can foster a greater sense of autonomy and responsibility for their own learning. Moreover, this study emphasises the significance of incorporating PjBL into hospitality education programmes, to prepare students for success in a rapidly changing world. https://doi.org/10.26803/ijlter.22.7.8\n",

Countries employed the Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) curriculum to ensure that their professionals uphold the expected third-world competencies. This study is sought to assess the cognitive skills and perception of the first-year nursing students in Isabela State University anchored to the OBE Curriculum of the 4IR. Mixed - method research approach was used to identify their perceptions of the OBE and assess their cognitive abilities. Simple Random Sampling Technique was used to select 51 participants. The adoption of the program showed an “Average” result in the learner’s mastery level. The subject Theoretical Foundation of Nursing (TFN) was substantiated to be the easiest subject taken by the learners out of the 8 Professional Subjects where test questions were mainly categorized as “LowerOrder-Thinking Skills”. On the other hand, Microbiology &amp; Parasitology, where “Higher-OrderThinking Skills” questions were assigned was found to be the most difficult. Their profile variable had no significant attribute to their cognitive abilities. Perceptively, most (36) learners had no ideaabout the nature and implementation of the OBE curriculum where the concurrent nursing program is integrated. Since factors were attributed to students, facilitators, and the OBE curriculum espousal, the abovementioned curriculum adoption and implementation need to be reinforced to meet the intended competencies of the modern global industrialization. Further studies need to be conducted that is aimed at scholarly enhancing the curriculum.\n",

      "Discussing the topic of special education teacher shortages across the United States has become commonplace. Although more widespread, special education teacher shortages in rural areas have gained less attention. Teachers in these areas face unique challenges such as overcoming geographic barriers to providing high-quality services, the isolation endemic to rural poverty, and having limited access to resources in schools. Additionally, students with disabilities living in rural areas are more likely to be supported by teachers who are ill-prepared, lack experience, and/or fail to possess the qualifications necessary to meet diverse learning needs. Addressing these challenges requires innovative partnerships between national, state, and university personnel to create systemic change to recruit and retain special educators. The purpose of this article is to describe a partnership between The Collaboration for Effective Educator Development, Accountability, and Reform (CEEDAR) Center, the Mississippi Department of Education (MDE), Education Preparation Programs (EPPs), including Delta State University, and a cross-section of special education directors in the Mississippi Delta and other regions that utilized The Educator Shortages in Special Education Toolkit (Hayes et al., 2019) as a guide, which resulted in the development of the Special Educator Mentoring Framework.

      "Students’ healthy engagement with higher education (HE) can make vital contributions to their psychosocial development, educational attainment and future employability. Therefore, it is important to take account of recent evolutions in how engagement is enabled, experienced, and assessed within Higher Education Institutes (HEIs). This shift is evidenced in the growing interconnectivity between HEIs’ interpersonal and digital engagement resources. Alongside this shift, staff and students’ reliance on digital mediation, wherein digital technologies are used to facilitate and sustain student communications, has grown exponentially in the wake of COVID-19. In light of the growing demand for digital mediation, evidenced across academic, advisory, and administrative domains, our research undertakes a qualitative exploration of Student Advisers’ (SAs) experiences interfacing between interpersonal and digital engagement resources. We examine SAs’ recent experiences of and attitudes towards student engagement, their insights into the proliferation of digital communications and the challenges and opportunities this entails, and how they have sought to ensure service continuity amid rapid transformations. &nbsp;By deconstructing the dichotomy between digital and interpersonal supports and recontextualising them within SAs’ lived experience, we aim to re-evaluate the nature and role of student engagement against the needs currently facing the HE sector. Here, we develop a conceptual matrix detailing student engagement’s core components and characteristics within a contemporary digitally-influenced context. Through this framework, we critique digital mediation’s role within and impact on HEIs, arguing that digital supports and resources constitute an increasingly critical component of interpersonal encounters between students and staff, rather than a substitute for them.\n",

There is an ever-growing demand for individuals who can process data, evaluate concepts, and develop arguments; the development of critical thinking skills is crucial. This study shows the effectiveness of a professional development model that aimed at improving teachers’ instructional design skills for nurturing critical thinking in the classroom. The study adopted a quantitative research approach in order to identify and assess the transformation in teachers’ pedagogical practices while developing lesson plans designed to elicit and nurture critical thinking among their learners. This study focused on a sample of 16 teachers at a secondary school in Central Uganda. The researcher purposefully selected the teachers, who specialised in three different subjects: English (5), mathematics (5), and history (6). The teachers who participated in the study were on average 32 years old and had 8 years of teaching experience. To evaluate the effectiveness of the lesson plans that the participants designed, the researcher developed a contextualised rubric that was then validated by experts to assess the teachers’ improvements in designing lessons for critical thinking enhancement. The findings confirmed that after the training intervention, the teachers showed a greater ability to differentiate between cognitive process and mere rote learning, helping them to elicit critical thinking in their students. At the end of the process, the lesson plans designed were clearer and more coherent, incorporating activities that could improve the learners’ critical-thinking skills.

      "English language education in India is undergoing significant transitions and challenges as the country continues to grow and develop. There are many new opportunities for teachers, but there are also several risks associated with these changes. This paper provides an overview of English language education in India, highlights some of the key issues that teachers face, and offers recommendations for how educators can best meet the needs of students and prepare them for a rapidly changing world. In recent years, there has been an increase in English-language schools all over India. This influx of new students has put a lot of pressure on traditional Indian educational institutions, such as universities, to adapt to this new environment and meet the needs of these newer students. Many colleges and universities are now offering degrees that include courses in English grammar, literature, journalism, business communication, etc., which were not previously part of their curricula. This shift away from traditional academic programs is indicative of another significant transition taking place within Indian society – one that is slowly but surely shifting away from its traditionally conservative values towards more liberal ones. With this change comes an increasing demand for knowledge and skills outside the traditional scope of study at Indian universities. Keywords: English language education, transitions and challenges, teachers, teaching subjects and knowledge and skills.\n",

What are the efforts of the Principal\\'s Leadership in Improving Teacher Professionalism in the 4.0 Revolution Era at the Empat Lima 1 Junior High School, Kedungpring Lamongan? The approach used by researchers is a qualitative approach. It is called qualitative because the problems discussed in this study are not related to numbers, but describe, describe, and describe the leadership of school principals in improving teacher professionalism in the revolutionary era 4.0 (Case Study of Junior High School Empat Lima 1 Kedungpring Lamongan) as it is . Qualitative research is research that intends to understand phenomena about what is experienced by research subjects such as behavior, perceptions, motivations, actions, holistically, and in a descriptive way in the form of words and language, in a special natural context and by utilizing various scientific method (Lexy J. Moleong, 2012).

The type of research that researchers use is case study researchers. A case study is a comprehensive description and explanation of various aspects of an individual, group, organization, program, social situation and so on. Surachmad (1982) explained that a case study is an approach that focuses on a case intensively and in detail (Wayan Suwendra, 2018). While the case study model that researchers use is the case study model of Robert K. Yin. According to Robert K. Yin, case studies are more desirable to track contemporary events, if the events concerned cannot be manipulated. Because of this, case studies are based on the same techniques by adding two sources of evidence that are usually not included in the historian\\'s options, namely observation and systematic interviews. Again, although case and historical studies may overlap, a unique strength of the case study is its ability to deal fully with a wide variety of types of documentary, equipment, interview, and observational evidence. Moreover, in some situations such as participant observation, informal manipulation can also occur.\n",

The purpose of this phenomenological qualitative study was to investigate the university lecturers\\' experiences in coping with the educational disruption as they suddenly transitioned from Face-to-Face (F2F) classes to Online Teaching (OT) during the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. Ten university lecturers in Thailand from seven different universities and seven faculties participated in 45-minute in-depth structured interviews via Line video calls. Despite the sudden inevitable shift to a new way of working, the participants were intrinsically motivated to make the necessary changes and adjustments, exhausting a lot of effort, time, and thought to ensure online education work for students. The effectiveness was not solely dependent on the lecturers, but also on the cooperation of students, which was reported to be lacking. Although the initial responses to online teaching were more of a shock, the two years of the new way of working actually transformed the attitude of some participants. Up to 40% of them were so satisfied with their new online teaching experience that they were willing to take up permanent online teaching positions. The varying amounts of time taken to adapt to the new way of working, and the satisfaction received were influenced by a couple of factors such as the training and support provided, the previous exposure to digital usage, and their previous familiarity with the platforms. Internet connectivity issues were a major frustration, while cheating and unresponsive students added to the existing frustrations that could not be remedied. It was no wonder why 50% of the participants wanted to move back to F2F teaching as they could eradicate those problems.\n",

We conducted this experimental study to examine the cooperative teaching impacts on the academic performance of students studying at the higher secondary school level in tehsil Faisalabad. Collaborative learning is a valuable instructional approach where students allocate tasks among themselves, assist each other (especially those who have difficulty), offer positive and negative feedback, and work together to achieve a collective outcome. Through such collaboration, students exhibit greater engagement and academic success. In this study, we compared students\\' academic performance by comparing the experimental and control group students. Control groups comprised of total 40 students. A single teacher conducted academic activities with them. Whereas in the experimental group, total 40 students were taught through the cooperative teaching method. The research design of the control was a pre-test and post-test, which is representative of true experimental design, and the same was applied to the experiment in this study. The results revealed that the students in the experimental group who were taught through a cooperative teaching approach academically performed better as compared to control. This implies that cooperative teaching technique had a positive influence on the students’ academic performance. This is concluded that the cooperative teaching technique was better as compared to the conventional method of teaching. Therefore, this cooperative method of teaching should be implemented for other subjects and at other school levels.\n",

The distance learning platform provides a unique opportunity to enhance the achievement of introverted students while promoting in-depth consideration of the learning objectives without disruption. Success in a distance learning classroom may provide more positive associations and confidence regarding the educational process. While more research needs to be done to explore whether introverted students have higher completion rates and scores using distance learning than a traditional classroom experience, it does appear to be a promising development for those students who prefer a lower stimuli environment where their contributions can be as significant as those of their extroverted peers. Though traditionally viewed as having fewer desirable skills, introverts typically score well in academic environments and can thrive in leadership positions. Exhibiting preferences for written communications and tendencies toward careful deliberation can help introverts succeed as leaders in many professional fields.

      "This study examined the extent to which the impact of a universal professional development (PD) intervention program on children’s early social-emotional learning (SEL) is dependent on early childhood education (ECE) teachers’ stress levels. The program (POMPedaSens) aimed to promote children’s (5–6-year-olds’) SEL by supporting ECE teachers’ PD. Intervention effectiveness was monitored using an 8-month randomized controlled trial design with an intervention group (IG; 26 teachers and 195 children) and a waiting control group (CG; 36 teachers and 198 children) that provided data before and after program implementation. ECE teachers in the IG were trained to implement the intervention program in their early childhood education and care groups. Latent change score analysis revealed that when teachers showed a low level of stress, children’s prosocial behavior increased only in the IG. There were no significant results for the IG in terms of a change in antisocial behavior. The results suggest a promising application of the PD intervention for promoting prosocial behavior in ECE when teachers have low stress. A longer intervention period is likely needed to determine the moderating effect of ECE teachers’ well-being on children’s antisocial behavior change. Unexpectedly, when teachers showed a high level of stress, an increase in prosocial behavior and a decrease in antisocial behavior were found for children in the CG. This could result from demands for accountability and high expectations regarding early prosocial behavior without supporting teachers’ PD and well-being, which can diminish social-emotional functioning in the long run. Decreased antisocial behavior in the CG could stem from an acquired propensity towards compliant behavior driven by either a sense of obedience or fear. High stress in the CG indicates that teachers were trying to do their best at the risk of their own well-being.\n",

      "Although Response to Intervention (RTI) is viewed as a promising model for preventing learning difficulties in reading, several authors have highlighted the challenges associated with its implementation in educational settings (Barrio et al., 2015; Fuchs &amp; Vaughn, 2012; Mitchell et al., 2012). After a decade of implementing this model in the United States, researchers insist on the need for more studies on the practical issues related to the implementation of this model (Barrio et al., 2015; Simonsen et al., 2010). The purpose of this article is to present the results of a multi-case study on the roles of teachers and remedial teachers in the context of the implementation of the RTI in reading in three elementary schools. It focuses more specifically on the organization of services based on the different evaluation and intervention procedures associated with the RTI. The results indicate the presence or emergence of a data culture in the three sites studied. It was possible to observe that RTI evaluation and intervention procedures are viewed as structuring benchmarks for organizing and planning services throughout the school year for first and second Grade students at-risk and those already struggling with reading difficulties.\n",

However, in special education, technology and the use of digital devices are heavily encouraged in the classrooms to provide a deeper, more effective, and more wholesome experience for kids. Personalization for promoting inclusive learning using AR is also a growing area of interest in the learning skills domain. Individuals with special needs are identified to experience deficits in learning categorical vocabularies and using languages in different contexts. This includes learning many subjects, in particular Science and Math. Vocabulary acquisition is very important for independent living and literacy skills and science are considered valuable for individuals with special needs. Hence the requirement for better and more efficient AR imagery to enhance the learning of vocabulary for special students. This proposal looks into the creative quality of the images needed in language, particularly in learning new words for the special child. It delves deep into how language is interpreted by special children on how to bring effective dynamic imagery using AR into the space to make learning effective, simple, and engaging. Quality and type of imagery needed for such children, which&nbsp; would induce better learning would be looked into, allowing us to create a metric system for the kind of images created for more engaging learning. This could be a set of guidelines for AR image creators for special education purposes. This would not only help educators in classrooms but also help learning and development centers devise more apt learning programs for disabled students using AR tech.\n",

This is because reflective practice aims to promote analytical thinking from the teachers learning experience for better teaching and ultimately better learning and can be done collaboratively with peers. This study explores more deeply how the understanding of science teachers includes the involvement of peers in their reflective practice. Appointed based on the teaching experience conducted by 16 science teachers in junior high schools in Kendari City, Southeast Sulawesi. The analysis procedure uses data organization through interviews, documents, or observations. The results indicate that the teachers views on reflective practice are divided into 4 understandings: (1) The process of rethinking what has been learned whether it has going well or not, (2) Evaluating the problems faced in learning and teaching process, (3) Self-awareness in assesing in learning and teaching process and use it to improve the next one and (4) Consideration about strategies, tools/media used, material content and student understanding during learning. Most of the reflective practices carried out by science teachers themselves, without involving colleagues or other related parties, also without any supporting instruments or evidence. This study suggests that reflective practice and reflective forums can become a mandatory policy for every school in order to develop science innovation and learning in the future.\n",

      "To improve educational outcomes through improvements in teaching standards, the Ministry of Education has stepped up efforts aimed at providing continuous and lifelong learning among Ghanaian teachers. However, the impact of the recent emphasis on a comprehensive framework for the professional development of teachers on teaching and learning outcomes has not been adequately studied. Despite the growing body of literature suggesting that professional development and professional knowledge may be associated with student outcomes, these relationships remain an open question. This study, therefore, sought to determine the impact of teachers’ professional development on academic performance in senior high schools in Ghana and the mediating role of teachers’ professional knowledge. A survey was conducted, and valid questionnaires were retrieved from 4,102 teachers in selected public senior high schools from four regions (including 77 districts and 97 public senior high schools) across the Southern, Middle, and Northern belts of Ghana. The results of the study showed that professional development has a significant positive relationship with professional knowledge (γ = 0.26, p &lt; 0.001). Also, professional development and professional knowledge were positively related to academic performance (γ = 0.08, p &lt; 0.001) and (γ = 0.04, p &lt; 0.001) respectively. Finally, the results of the study showed that professional knowledge partially mediated the relationship between professional development and academic performance. The study, therefore, concluded that professional development leads to improvements in the academic performance of students through improvements in teachers’ professional knowledge and other characteristics of teachers that were not accounted for by this study. Among other things, the study recommends that teachers should be encouraged to engage in diverse professional development activities that respond to the inadequacies in their professional competencies.\n",

The instrument used for the study was self-structure questionnaire which was entitle “Perception of Principals Leadership Styles on Students Truancy Questionnaire in Senior Secondary Schools” (PPLSSTQSSS). The instrument was validated by two experts from the Department of Educational Foundations, Faculty of Education, Federal University of Kashere. In testing the reliability of the instrument pilot study was conducted in none of the sample schools not covered by the study, Cronbach Alpha of reliability was employed and a reliability coefficient index of 0.75 was obtained. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The findings of the study showed that truancy was a problem experienced in all the schools under study. Democratic leadership styles were popularly used by the principals in Zamfara metropolis. The various leadership styles employed by various principals had a great impact on truancy. Autocratic leadership style was found out to be associated with harshness and leaders who practice this style of leadership are always distant from teachers and students. The study concluded that truancy was caused by factors such as inability to cope with academic pressure, dislike for the school environment caused administration techniques used by school leadership, lack of school fees, sickness, problems related to family background. The study recommended awareness campaign among school administrators to enhance their understanding on the circumstances in which each leadership style is appropriate.

      "Background:Covid-19 has gravely affected almost all activities of life worldwide; education is no exception. To overcome this situation most educational institutes tried to change the mode of education from usual face-to-face learning to E-learning.Objective: To determine the perceptions of students towards different modes of distant teaching and its impact on effective learning during the Covid 19 era.Method:That was a descriptive study that focused on the students of graduation level in Karachi, Pakistan in different private universities. Most of the students were taking online classes after the announcement of the Covid-19 pandemic. The primary data was collected through an online questionnaire from November 2020 to December 2020. All the students who filled the questionnaire at the time of collecting data were included in the study. Two universities were selected, the total number of students in both universities was 600. With the help of Raosoft software we calculate the sample size. The total Population of these universities was 600, according to software need 235 students as a sample size. We used SPSS for statistical analysis with a 0.05 level of significance.Results:In our study, 57.4 % were male, and the remaining 42.6% were female respondents. As per responses, it was evident that before COVID-19 i.e. during the face-to-face study, the maximum use of digital tools in learning three to six hours, six to nine hours, and nine to twelve hours was just 28.9 %, 6.3%, and 1.47 % respectively.Whereas, due to online study, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of digital tools in learning for the same duration increased manifold to 40.2 %, 31%, and 8 % respectively. This prolonged use of digital tools affects the sleeping habits of students and also causes tiredness and exhaustion. According to responses mobile phone was commonly used for e-learning. During e-learning, students could not concentrate on study properly and get distracted easily. Distance learning resulted not only in isolation of students but long stay at home caused laziness. Students did not recommend the continuous learning model because that is unhealthy and caused stress, frustration, and depression and are one of the reasons for low academic performance and lead to confusion as compared to face-to-face interaction which boosts the students’ performance. More than half (54%) students like and are comfortable with online quizzes and exams.Conclusion:It is concluded that in Pakistan, despite gaining colossal popularity nowadays, advanced innovative teaching has still not been comfortable for students in learning. Students are still more slanted towards face-to-face learning rather than e-learning. Educational institutes need to take essential measures for progressing online instructing quality to assist with better learning of students during the Covid 19 pandemic.Keywords: Covid 19, Pandemic, Effect learning, E-learning\n",

However the consistent failure in science subjects (especially girls), crucial in national industrialisation and development framework, government continued grapple with the COVID pandemic effects, socio-economic hurdles such as; early pregnancies, change of mindset for both students and sponsors and body physiological changes among learners are stumbling blocks to continued education. Both government and private education institutions need to tackle such hurdles collectively, hence a desire to advise on the way forward as schools prepare to open. The study employed quasi experimental design where 100 students on holiday (50 girls and 50 boys) were sampled from the villages in Buhweju, Mitooma, Rubiriizi and Sheema districts to watch videos on selected topics in science subjects and later assessed on their mastery and competences. We used a t-test approach to compare the achievements of both girls and boys subjected to an ICT mediated student-centered learning environment. We found out that there is a slight significant difference in their performance which was largely attributed to family chore overload on the girls’ side. The findings further provided valuable information to promote active student-centered learning approach using available Information Technology devices. We thus conclude that ICT enabled learning registers big achievement in drawing attention of the learner and permits the teacher to concentrate on assessment and self-evaluation which are vital in effective teaching and learning. Therefore, schools should promote self-directed study activities among learners and teachers put extra time in modes and dynamics of assessment.\n",

This paper reviews two decades of historical progress in health literacy and advances a new conceptual model to organize Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment (CIA) themes for Health Literacy Education (HLE). Three themes are integrated into the Health Literacy Education (HLE) curriculum: 1) interprofessional communication in HLE, 2) cultural and linguistic competencies in HLE, and 3) a language typology that informs HLE. Two pedagogical themes are integrated into HLE instruction: 1) skill-based instructional strategies to improve oral communication (n = 7), and skill-based instructional strategies to improve written communication (n = 3). Skill-based instructional strategies to improve oral communication of medical and health professions students includes use of plain language, use of Teach Back or Show Me, encourage patients to ask questions, use medical interpreters and translators, be an active listener, respond with empathy when breaking bad news to patients, and use Chunks and Checks method. Skill-based instructional strategies to improve written communication of medical and health professions students includes write in plain language, evaluate written materials, and use pictures or visual aids to aid patient understanding. Two themes are integrated into HLE assessments: 1) formative assessment, and 2) summative assessment. The paper promotes the Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment Framework for Health Literacy Education (CIA-HLE) for use by faculty in medical and health professions schools to ensure their students are well prepared to use oral and written communication with their patients as guided by selected research studies and initiatives. To further advance interprofessional collaboration and dialogue across the medical and health professions, a language typology and a knowledge typology are provided as building blocks to health literacy education.\n",

      "Context: This study is about vocational education and training for adults within municipal adult education (MAE). Sweden has a long tradition of adult education, and has one of the world\\'s highest proportions of participants in adult education. The Swedish education system is characterised by extensive marketisation with many private actors, particularly in adult education. The focus of this article is on the enactment of the market orientation in vocational adult education, with the purpose of showing how vocational adult education is organised in different ways in Swedish municipalities and how national adult education policy is enacted in local VET practices. Methods: The data consist of documents presenting relevant national policies for adult education, in particular on vocational education, and semi-structured interviews with adult education leaders in 20 municipalities. Findings: The findings show that MAE in Sweden has a clear labour market focus on offering education that corresponds to working life\\'s labour requirements. Most municipalities have a shortage of staff in elderly care and childcare, which is why they offer a large number of training places in these professions. Many immigrants choose these training programmes to get a job. It is also common for municipalities to offer these training programmes in combination with SFI (Swedish for immigrants). This means that MAE fulfils an important function for integration. VET in MAE is offered as school-based training, apprenticeships or distance education. Offering VET at a distance makes it possible to provide a wider range of training programmes, and enables people who have difficulties participating in on-site training (due to commitments such as work or young children) to take part. Apprenticeship training provides work experience and often leads to employment. However, a weak interest in apprenticeship training among students and difficulties finding apprenticeship placements are examples of reasons why the number of apprenticeships is often very limited. Conclusion: Swedish MAE is characterised by flexibility and a broad supply of courses. However, there is a clear focus on certain vocational areas – mainly within the municipal organisation. This gives reason to question whether publicly funded VET for adults should mainly prepare participants for publicly funded labour-market sectors, or whether other sectors could also benefit from newly trained adults. Since vocational training within MAE is of great importance for immigrants\\' establishment in the labour market, there is a risk that unilateral investments in certain vocations will limit immigrants\\' career opportunities. \n",

One of the modern educational pedagogies which can be utilized by educators to inculcate students’ critical thinking skills and improve student learning effectively is the problem-based learning (PBL) approach. The Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest databases have been used to source published scientific literature on this topic and develop themes of critical thinking abilities in teaching through PBL for students. This study revealed four major themes and nine sub-themes with regards to critical thinking skills in teaching in relation to PBL. The major themes consisted of the learning environment, content, process, and human capital. The review revealed that most of the studies were conducted to understand critical thinking skills in problem-based learning. This study found that PBL was a major approach used in teaching students, as well as a wide range of other techniques that may develop diverse abilities, such as thinking critically and creatively, solving problems, collaborating, communicating effectively, and global literacy. This paper also highlights the challenges in developing critical thinking among students and identifies topics for further research. https://doi.org/10.26803/ijlter.21.2.19\n",

      "Higher-order Thinking Skills (HOTS) is a concept that is being debated by researchers, particularly in the context of education. Teachers are expected to develop materials that enable the students to have higher order thinking skills, increase their creativity, and build students’ autonomy in solving the problem. The ability of students to think with HOTS in the teaching and learning process is a difficult assignment for teachers to do. The classroom process and assessment are designed to meet the students’ needs of improving their HOTS Teachers must expand their knowledge of HOTS in order to provide optimal and successful online instruction. The goal of this study is to look into teachers\\' knowledge of HOTS and how they use it in online teaching. This is a qualitative study, and the research design is a case study. The information was gathered through in-depth interviews andobservation. The participants of this research were three English teachers from a senior high school who teach different grades. The findings found that teachers failed to clearly communicate the concept of thinking and thinking processes, and that the majority of teachers were unable to explain HOTS as critical and creative thinking. However, their use of HOTS in the online classroom revealed that they use it to help students activate their HOTS\n",

      "This study aims to determine to what extent the education system of Islamic boarding schools (known as Pondok Pesantren) is related to the model of interpersonal communication and pesantren students (known as santri) readiness to learn can contribute to their success while taking the level in higher education. The authors used the quantitative method as the research approach. This research was conducted at the Pondok Pesantren \\\"Anwarul Huda\\\" Karang Basuki, Malang. To solve the problems in this study, two statistical analysis techniques were used, namely descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis. The results of this study indicated that first, most of the santri studying at higher educational institutions (universities) had poor interpersonal communication, quite good learning readiness, and good learning outcomes. Second, the santri’s interpersonal communication model and learning readiness significantly contribute to university learning outcomes achievement by 7.6% and other factors that influence the rest. This analysis indicates that santri’s interpersonal communication and learning readiness have not been optimally carried out in Islamic boarding schools. Therefore, every educator should always provide directions to generate and develop santri’s interpersonal communication model and learning readiness to maximize their learning outcomes in higher education.\n",

      "This article explains about the context of multimedia and hypermedia which including the ways how to integrating multimedia and hypermedia for teaching and learning. As we advance towards a digital age, today\\'s technologies allow educators and students to integrate, combine, and interact with media far beyond what was previous possible. As the computer and the internet are very strongly integrated into every life and in education especially as well as in school education. A new method to teach for example teachers facilitate learning by encouraging active learning, guide learners to question their tacit assumptions, enhance learning environment, support students center, and coach them in the construction process. Therefore, we should think about some idea “integrating educational technology\\\" which refers to the process of determining which electronic tools such as multimedia and hypermedia or which methods for implementing them are appropriate for given classroom situations and problems.  The concept of multimedia refers to a combination of multiple media combined into a single whole. Indeed multimedia today is synonymous with a computer-based format that combines text, graphics, audio, and even video into single coherent, digital presentation. Hypermedia refers to linked media. Furthermore multimedia software is typically arranged in a hypermedia format that follows the learner to jump among these elements to follow his or her own learning style and personal curiosity. Multimedia and Hypermedia: How do they differ? Multimedia/ hypermedia makes one\\'s experience as realistic as possible without actually being there. Multimedia/ hypermedia encourages students to take responsibility for their own learning and support them to learn at their own pace. Multimedia/ hypermedia provides for students participation in the learning experience, and allow the teacher to play more of a coaching role, moving around the classroom and supporting individual help to students. In this article we will explore the following types of multimedia/hypermedia: Multimedia kits, Interactive media, and Virtual reality. Because of some advantages as mentioned above we hope that the approach which integrating multimedia/ hypermedia for teaching and learning will be applied into efficient instruction.\n",

Research explicitly highlights the disparity that at-risk children and children with a disability may face in the classroom, as well as the longstanding ripple effects of early language and literacy disadvantage. Stemming from these foundations, the purpose of this literature review is to analyse the impact of literacy intervention strategies on early childhood students in mainstream Australian classroom settings. The paper will utilise formative classroom data in the form of teacher directed lesson observations in a student driven learning setting to obtain evidence of the effectiveness of implemented literacy interventions. Data will be collected through observational notes and a student reading level progression bar graph over a five-week period with literacy intervention lessons being run three times per week for one-hour sessions. There will be a direct emphasis on exploring the importance of primary literacy intervention in the inclusive early learning classroom, with a particular focus on the developmental process of reading in young learners. This review will also explore how the effective development of reading competence shapes learning and social development for years to come; unpacking current research literature and discussing a key selection of evidence-based intervention strategies utilised to bridge learning disparities for young readers.\n",

Primary school teachers re-evaluate their discourse and learning environments they use in the classroom. The negative results obtained in exams such as PISA and TIMMS and researchs on the subject, made it necessary to seek an answer to the question of what the deficiencies are in teaching thinking skills in classrooms. The aim of this study is to examine what happened in the learning-teaching process in classrooms in the context of gaining thinking skills at the primary school level. The case study design was adopted as a method in the study. The participants of the study carried out in one province in the North-East Anatolia region of Turkey were one class teacher working in a public primary school and 20 students. Unstructured observation and interview techniques were used to collect data. The obtained data were analyzed by following the qualitative data analysis steps and by performing content analysis on the data. After analyzing the data, five sub-themes were reached within the framework of one theme. Some of the research findings are that the classroom teacher makes behaviors and discourses that prevent students from thinking, the materials used in the transfer of the content do not encourage thinking, and the communication element that is important for thinking skills in the classroom is one dimensional. Based on the findings, it has been suggested to include examples of activities that will support thinking skills while preparing the contents and activities of the textbooks, and to give practical and long-lasting trainings to teachers about thinking education through pre-service lessons and in-service training.\n",

This study aimed to identify the relationship between Learning-Centred Leadership (KBP), Professional Learning Community (KPP), and Teacher Self-Efficacy (EKG) in National Secondary School (SMK) in Sarawak, Malaysia. Another important objective of the study was to identify whether KPP was a mediator between KBP and EKG. A stratified random sampling method was used to determine the study sample. The data were analyzed using the SEM AMOS Version 26.0 and Confirmation Factor Analysis (CFA) involved 794 samples. The findings showed that KBP was found to have a significant relationship with KPP (β = .73, p &lt; .001), whereas KPP had a significant relationship with EKG (β = .54, p &lt; .001). The KPP was found as a full mediator of the relationship between KBP and EKG. The findings imply that school principals who practice KBP will be able to enhance EKG effectively if they promote KPP in schools. The study has provided some useful insights for the Sarawak State Education Department and Ministry of Education Malaysia in planning courses and training programs towards improving the professionalism of school principals and teachers.

      "When schools locked down owing to the spread of COVID-19, Danish upper secondary school students worked on the major written assignment that completes their studies. This assignment is interdisciplinary, and students receive up to twenty hours of supervision from two teachers. This year, supervision was reorganised into a virtual format. This article explores how and in what ways students benefited from this reorganisation. This article is based on a mixed-methods design that includes quantitative and qualitative data and investigates how various online supervision formats support dialogic interaction. This article focuses on the student’s experience of supervision. It finds that all the formats we investigated offer the opportunity for dialogue during supervision, but their potential varies significantly. Some formats seem to have great potential for supporting students’ academic development, whereas others support their psychosocial development. We conclude by addressing the importance of choosing the online format suited to a given purpose and recommend that supervisors be aware of the didactic purposes of the various formats.\n",

The present study was carried out to analyse the gap between the expected and the achieved generic competences among the 1st year students of Bachelor of Education. Methodology The sample of the study was collected from 10 universities of the Punjab (Pakistan). 1st year students of Bachelor of Education were selected as the respondents of the study. Competence scale was used to collect data from the students. The scale, which included 19 competences, was adopted from the Reflex Project (an international project). Findings: The reliability of the scale was 0.81. Expectation-achievement gap was not observed in 12 out of 19 competences; but the gap was found in the rest i.e.&nbsp; the seven competences including writing and speaking in a foreign language, mobilizing others’ capacity, performing well under pressure, using computers and the internet, readiness to new opportunities, and acquiring new knowledge rapidly. Implication to Research and Practice: This study revealed that both indicators (i.e. expectation-achievement) were less than the optimal level. The study also predicted that comprehensibly, sensitization and reorganization of the learning experiences might narrow gap between students’ expectation and their achievement of generic competences.\n",

Multiliteracy offers fresh perspectives on language education and learning. The usage of multiliteracy in Indonesia provides potential benefits, such as the growth of pupils\\' literacy levels. Multiliteracy adds a new dimension to education and allows instructors to take an alternative approach to teach, moving away from the conventional teacher-centered method towards a more student-centered approach. Furthermore, it places the emphasis on critical thinking, cultural awareness, and fresh insight. Students are encouraged and expected to be more curious when studying multiliteracy since they will be able to explore and learn on their own. Educators in Indonesia, on the other hand, should not be unfamiliar with the notion of multiliteracy.

By the developments and demands of the times, Islamic education must present itself as flexible, responsive, future-oriented, balanced, oriented to superior quality, egalitarian, fair, democratic, dynamic, open, lifelong. Etc. Islamic education should experience innovation by its nature and character from time to time, starting from the system and institutions. Moreover, today\\'s current global turbulence for Islamic education is a lifestyle, food style, entertainment style, and dress style (food, fun, and fashion).

      "Misconceptions impact learning and behavior. Students’ misconceptions are often persistent. But research has shown that some strategies of dealing with them are more likely to lead to conceptual change than others. Thus, it is important for teachers that they can notice students’ misconceptions and then use evidence-based strategies to deal with them. This study uses data from online questionnaires. Data was collected in the German speaking area of Switzerland. The sample consists of geography and/or RZG teacher students for secondary school that had already taught in school (n=83). RZG is a subject similar to social studies. The results show that the majority of participants saw themselves as constructivist. Yet, a considerable share said they had not noticed any misconceptions in their students. Of those who did, a large share did not describe any strategy how they dealt with them. Among those who described a strategy, evidence-based strategies were rare. Some were not even mentioned once. Thus, it seems that conceptual change research does not impact the practice of many teacher students.

      "The enactment of higher education policies has followed an unprecedented sequence of innovation around blended and hybrid learning because of the gradual dissemination of pedagogical and technological developments. These include quality assurance, qualification frameworks, employability programs, international mobility of students and teachers, and pedagogical training for higher education teachers. However, in early 2020 all universities across the world were compelled to shift abruptly to online teaching at a short notice, thus introducing online pedagogies that employ video conferencing software (such as Zoom, Teams, Meet and many others), learning management systems (such as Blackboard, Canvas, Moodle, and others) and online examination systems (such as Inspera). Today, many teachers have used these digital tools and virtual suites to reshape course designs, delivery, and evaluation. Although these tools were previously available, few had foreseen that they would be adopted at such a wide, global scale. In this handbook, we explore how higher education institutions have used blended and hybrid learning to respond to the Covid-19 lockdown, particularly how institutional leaders and some teachers perceived that type of emergency education, and to what extent the whole process is changing the paradigm. To this end, the authors interviewed thirty-nine leaders and teachers who were involved in the management of this transition in six universities located in France, Norway, Poland, Portugal, and Spain.\n",

      "This descriptive study explores the reality of applying Project-based Learning (PBL) in the context of lower and upper secondary schools in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. It also aims to investigate the challenges English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers encounter in applying PBL in their actual language teaching classes. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were employed to collect the quantitative and qualitative data for this study. A total of 80 EFL teachers from 12 provinces of the Mekong Delta participated in the research, including 8 teachers purposively selected from the population for the interviews. The findings of the present research revealed that team PBL and classroom PBL were implemented most in EFL teachers’ teaching contexts. At the same time, whole-school PBL was seldom conducted due to its complexity in implementation. Most teachers fully carried out the step-by-step process of PBL implementation in their teaching. The results also indicated that EFL teachers face certain challenges when implementing PBL. The major challenges included challenges related to curriculum in terms of lack of time, no specific guidance and assessment criteria for PBL implementation; challenges related to students regarding their mixed abilities, differences in interests and learning styles, and lack of necessary materials and skills for doing projects; and challenges related to teachers comprising adaptation of project activities, lack of time for student support, and controlling large classes. These results provide insightful pedagogical implications for how PBL can be more feasible, applicable, and successful in Vietnamese teaching contexts.  Article visualizations:\n",

      "With the advent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), several institutions worldwide have adopted the blended mode of teaching and learning. However, literature on this concept in South Africa and on the African continent is scarce. This scoping review explores the concept of blended approach to training and how to design resources for the blended teaching and learning approach. In addition, the review investigates barriers to the implementation of blended learning. The findings of this study demonstrate that the understanding of the concept of blended teaching and learning is not homogenous and is often left to individual academics to decide on the approach. The review identified several hurdles that need to be addressed for successful implementation of blended teaching and learning, however these are not specific to South African institutions. Available literature on studies done elsewhere and in South African, suggest that some of the identified barriers to adoption of blended teaching and learning are real, while others are perceived or imagined. Lastly, the authors observed that there are several approaches to designing learning resources for the blended mode of teaching and learning. The choice of approach is dependent on the intended purpose for which the specific design is adopted. There is a need for studies that specifically investigate blended learning in Universities in South Africa and on the continent to help identify barriers to adopting blended teaching and learning among institutions that are specific to the South African and African context. Institutions adopting the blended teaching and learning mode of delivery, need to be unambiguous in their philosophy of blending teaching and learning and not leave it to the implementing academics. Policymakers can use the information generated in this review to recommend minimum requirements for a blended delivery mode in public institutions of higher learning.\n",

      "Lesson Study (LS) is a teaching improvement and knowledge-building process that has origins in Japanese elementary education. In Japanese LS, teachers work in small teams to plan, teach, observe, analyse and refine individual lessons called research lessons. This study examined a small sample of primary school teachers’ perceptions of LS as a professional learning endeavour. The benefits and challenges teachers experienced when attempting to engage in LS was further explored. The study focused on the Fijian primary teaching context, specifically on Year 8 mathematics teachers. Data was collected using a series of class observations and semi-structured interviews in two case-study schools. Analysis of classroom observations and semi-structured interviews confirms that LS provided a useful mode for teachers to talk about their mathematics lessons and open them for scrutinisation by their teaching colleagues. The findings suggest that all the teachers in the two schools found that LS is a powerful learning platform to improve teachers’ mathematical knowledge and pedagogical skills. These findings have important implications for the implementation of effective professional learning amongst practising primary school teachers.\n",

      "This study aimed to determine the impact of the instructional media development system on the academic performance of the college students of selected schools in ARMM Region as basis for instructional media center. Specifically, this sought to answer five research questions. The first research question focused on the profile of the student-respondents in terms of age; gender; province; ethnicity; type of the high school graduated from; type of residence; occupation of parents; and college/university presently enrolled. The second research question dealt on the extent of instructional media development system as perceived by the student-respondents in terms of: instructional media as laboratory of learning; physical facilities and environment of instructional media and instructional media as part of school curriculum. The third research question concentrated on the academic performance of the college students of selected schools in ARMM Region in History subject. The fourth research question emphasized on the significant influence of the instructional media development system on the academic performance of the student-respondents of selected schools in ARMM Region. Finally, the last research question is on the significant difference in the instructional media development system as perceived by the student-respondents when the data is analyzed according to their profile. This study was guided by two null hypotheses tested at .05 levels of significance. The first hypothesis states that there is no significant influence of the instructional media development system on the academic performance of the student-respondents of selected schools in ARMM Region and the second hypothesis states that there is no significant difference in the instructional media development system as perceived by the student-respondents when the data is analyzed according to their profile. This study is essentially a descriptive-quantitative research design employing descriptive-survey method that aimed to determine the effect of the instructional media development system on the academic performance of the students in History subject. To obtain the needed data, the researcher employed the purposive random sampling method, using 50 students taking history subject in each college. The distribution of the sample was composed of 25 males and 25 females randomly chosen from the history classes. The samples of the study were the first-year college students who are taking history subject in the second semester of school year 2007 2008. 150 first year college students were included as the population sample in the three provinces. 50 from Basilan State College, Isabela City, Basilan Province, 50 students from Sulu State College, Jolo, Sulu and 50 students from MSU-TCTO, Tawi-Tawi Province. The survey-questionnaire was used as the main instrument for the research. The researcher, however, is aware that the questionnaire tool of the investigation had inherent limitations. The value of this type of Investigation largely depends on the sincerity, truthfulness, and objectivity of the respondents. It cannot be entirely free of bias; hence, interviews and observations were also utilized for verification. The survey questionnaire consisted of three parts. Part I of the questionnaire provides information on the students profile in terms of age, gender, province, ethnicity, residence, type of residence, type of school graduated, occupations of the parents and college/university presently enrolled. Part II gathered information on the extent of instructional media development system in terms of (a.) instructional media as learning laboratory; (b) physical facilities and environment of instructional media; (c) instructional media as part of school curriculum. The documentary analysis was also used to provide the data on the academic performance of the students in the History subject. Data were taken from the registrar office of the different schools. The statistical tools used in analyzing the data were encoding the frequencies in computer through Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) and converting these frequencies to obtain the weighted arithmetic mean was utilized to assess and explore the extent of the instructional media development system in terms of instructional media as laboratory of learning, instructional media as instructional materials and instructional media as part of school curriculum as perceived by the student respondents. Mean and Standard Deviation was used to identify the academic performance of the college students of selected schools in ARMM Region in History subject. One-Way ANOVA was employed to determine the difference in the extent of the instructional media development system as perceived by the student-respondents when they are grouped according to their profile such as province, ethnicity, occupation of parents and college/university where they enrolled. T-Test Independent/uncorrelated was employed to determine the difference in the extent of the instructional media development system as perceived by the student-respondents when they are grouped according to their profile such as gender, age, type of residence and type of high school. Multiple Regression Analysis was used to identify the influence on the instructional media development system on the academic performance in History subject of the student-respondents. Cronbach Alpha was used to obtain the high reliability coefficient of the research instrument. Most of the student-respondents belong to the first category with ages ranging below to 20 years and some to the second category with the age ranging from 21 years old and above. Most of them are male and they belong to Tausug. They were living in and outside citio (Capital Town/city) of Isabela, Jolo and Bongao. The respondents are equally selected from the three provinces. Equal number of students selected from Sulu State College, Basilan State College, and Mindanao State University-Tawi-Tawi College of Technology and Oceanography, and they graduated from Public High School whose parents are Government Employee. On the extent of the instructional media development system as perceived by the student-respondents indicates that instructional media as laboratory of learning is moderately extensive as perceived by the students respondent of the three provinces of ARMM region as well as on instructional media development system as part of school curriculum. However, in terms of physical facilities and environment of instructional media development system as assessed by the respondents manifested a great extent of its uses. The standard deviation of the grades in History subject of the freshmen students in college or university of the three provinces shows that the level of achievements are approximately homogeneous, the achievement are closed to each other. The level of achievements in History of the college and university freshmen students in the three provinces is satisfactory. The instructional media development system does not influence on the academic performance of the college students in History subject. It is pointed out base from the results that the regression revealed none of the three (3) identified variables of instructional media development system influence the academic performance of the college students in history subject. Significant differences do not exist in the instructional media development system as perceived by the respondents when analyzed according to age, residence, type of high school graduated but in terms of respondents\\' gender the significant difference does exist using the T-test uncorrelated or independent. Analysis of Variance on the extent of the instructional media development system as perceived by the student-respondents when they are categorized according to their ethnicity, province and college/university presently enrolled found out to have significant differences while in terms of occupation of the respondents\\' parents, the significant difference does not exist among the variables tested in the study.\n",

      "Despite continuous and enormous attempts to improve English language teaching and learning in Thailand, a specifically designed teaching model which responds to low English proficiency students’ needs, interests, and contexts in rural schools was still needed. This study developed an innovative instructional model based on key agents’ voices on problems and needs in teaching and learning English in a rural context. Based on both global and local standards – the Common European Framework for Language References (CEFR) and Thailand’s Basic Education Core Curriculum (2008), the model, so-called TIGA, combined task-based learning approach (T), the input of target language (I), genre-based approach (G), and authentic assessment (A). TIGA-based teaching lessons were empirically designed and developed to facilitate English learning so that students can accomplish real-world tasks. The two-group pretest-post-test design was employed. Participants included 44 secondary school students purposively selected from two seventh grade classes at two Thai rural schools. The TIGA model and TIGA-based lessons were implemented with an experimental group of 28 secondary school students at one school. Pre- and post-tests were used to assess both groups of students’ English proficiency levels, followed by semi-structured interviews to investigate their attitudes towards the model and lesson implementation. The results showed a significant difference between the students’ English abilities in the experimental and control groups. The study also revealed that the instructional model could motivate and engage the low-ability students to improve their level of English proficiency.

The humanistic inclusion education curriculum can be developed through a curriculum modification process that combines the national education curriculum, local content, and the characteristics of children with special needs. Al-Azhaar Islamic Primary School is one of the educational institutions that has successfully organized inclusive education to improve students’ abilities academically and socially in a humanist manner.  This research uses the field study and case study qualitative methods. Data collection techniques involve in-depth interviews, participant observations, and documentation studies. The results of this study show that effective inclusive education is designed and implemented by combining normal children with those with special needs. Learning requires adjustment (modification) of teaching materials, methods, media, funds, class management, and the learning environment. Teachers find it difficult to carry out learning if the curriculum is not modified; not only do students have to adapt to the situation and the substance of education, but learning must also adjust to the student’s abilities, learning speed, difficulties, and interest in learning. A child with special needs is not forced to master competencies that are beyond his or her ability.  Children with special learning needs are not asked to keep up with students without learning disabilities but neither are they left waiting for their slower friends.

      "DOI: https://doi.org/10.36896/5.1pp4 The importance of contextualization within postsecondary contexts has been embraced by the state of Texas, as shown by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board’s (THECB) Accelerate Texas Initiative (THECB, n.d.). Contextualization, in short, is the teaching and development of basic skills and knowledge within a specific disciplinary topic (Perin, 2011). Perin (2011) claims that transfer of learning theories and learner motivation theories suggest that contextualization is one means of improving instructional methods within the postsecondary context. According to the THECB (2016), Accelerate Texas programs are designed to integrate or contextualize basic reading, math, and writing skills with workforce training, providing students with opportunities for college transition and entry into high demand occupations. The Education Institute (TEI), a grant-funded center within the College of Education at Texas State University, has provided educators with contextualized professional development modules that can be utilized in a variety of postsecondary courses.\n",

      "Digital technology can be used in many different ways to help students develop research skills. For example, online search engines can be used to help students find information more quickly and easily. Additionally, online research databases can be used to help students locate relevant scholarly articles. Also noteworthy is the fact that online forum discussions can help students learn from each other and develop research skills. This study analyzes the main advantages of digital technology and interactive laboratories in the formation of research skills of students in higher education, describes the main directions of development of research skills of students in higher education on the basis of digital technology and interactive laboratories. Interactivity in laboratories plays an important role in designing learning environments. Interactive laboratories provide an opportunity for students to engage in hands-on and minds-on learning. This type of laboratory allows students to experiment, test their ideas, and receive feedback in a safe and controlled environment. In an interactive laboratory, students are able to work together to solve problems and learn from each other. The use of interactive laboratories can help students to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The article concludes that there is less money being put towards laboratories, which makes it hard to keep them up-to-date. This means that universities are having to look for ways to save money.\n",

The E-Model, developed by Atkins &amp; Karplus (1962) as a research-based approach implies that the learners construct new knowledge on their own (Lynch, 2017). The present paper then suggests the implementation of the instructional E-Model in teaching scientific content to Master students through a Self-Directed Approach. The study is exploratory and experimental in its scope and aims at unleashing university students’ desire to construct new knowledge through a reflective model composed of a set of stages: engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation. Participant observation was used as a tool to obtain qualitative data. The findings demonstrated that the E-Model was effective as a constructivist teaching approach for a great majority of the students, and this was reflected through their skills in presenting and manipulating new information.

      "Formative assessment has become a most discussed topic when many countries recognized the importance of assessment for learning in enhancing students’ holistic development. Most of the times, teachers are not quite clear with the differences between assessment of learning and assessment for learning. In Malaysia, teachers still feel uncomfortable with the implementation of formative assessment compared to summative assessment due to the heavy workload to prepare the tests by themselves. Hence, this study was conducted to examine the role of leaders and how the leader’s role was associated with teachers’ formative assessment practices in schools. An online questionnaire was administered to a total of 198 randomly selected teachers from 25 public primary schools in Petaling. A descriptive correlational research design was employed to identify the relationship between these two variables. The findings indicated that there was a moderately strong linear relationship between the role of the leaders and teachers’ formative assessment practices in schools. The study also revealed that the role of leaders has significantly predicted the teachers’ formative assessment practices with 20.4% of contribution. &nbsp;The findings showed that teachers’ practices in formative assessment process still far from much desired, and leaders still need to further enhance their implementation of formative assessment in school. Overall, this study has its contribution for the enrichment of the body of knowledge of formative assessment and provided insights for the improvement of the implementation of formative assessment in schools.\n",

This is compounded for international students who speak English as a second or third language. However, international students are an integral part of higher education in the United Kingdom. Strategies that are specifically designed for international students that support wellbeing are somewhat lacking across the sector (Shu et al, 2020). The aim of this initiative is to embed academic and communication skills into students’ programmes of study in the form of weekly 2-hour academic skills classes. This small-scale study is based on the experience of teaching MA Education students, 95% of whom are Chinese. Classes focus on developing students’ understanding of critical thinking and writing, supporting their academic reading and ensuring that they understand academic conventions in the UK such as referencing and academic writing structure. Classes also provide another layer of support and social interaction for students which we hope support student wellbeing. We surveyed 40 students about how the classes support their participation and interaction, alleviate anxiety and help to develop their sense of belonging. We followed this up with students interviewing each other on their experiences of academic skills development classes. Members of the teaching team observed the interviews and took notes. This paper will report on our findings and make recommendations for how to further improve support for international PGTs.\n",

Coding, keywords, and classification are then used to process the data. Miles and Huberman\\'s procedures are employed in data analysis. The findings demonstrated that teachers\\' professional orientation does not end at the point of demonstrating competence but rather develops unique teacher-learner relations. Both internal and external factors have an impact on the professional development of teachers. Internal competence development entails taking several calculated actions. The professional development of teachers is an endeavor to reenergize instructors that are carried out outside of classrooms. Observations of the teaching profession are generally becoming more forward-looking. The idealization is consistent with the official government policies.\n",

      "In XXI century the interest of appropriate peculiarities of social development and the creativity of social intellect is increased in the civil society. “I” and its “importance of myself” in consciousness cannot improve itself, but it needs social environment and social position. At this point “I” and its “importance of myself” is harmonized with inventive, creative and imaginative features.The peculiarities of social intellect demand creative and inventive approach to the point of view of social benefits and social development. We call it “sociocreative”. This article examines the education for the whole child, as fostered historically by educators and philosophers, requires that teachers attend to all developmental domains such as the: social, aesthetic, language, affective, physical, and cognitive, including the spiritual dimension (Clark, 1991). Nevertheless, in the United States the spiritual dimension has been excluded systematically from the educational processes. Schools have imposed a silence regarding sharing about the inner life (Bosacki, 2002) that is both problematic and contradictory in the context of this democratic society. That silence becomes problematic because people in society, as Wright (2000) describes, seem to feel an urgency to search for the meaning and purpose of their lives, and the educational processes are completely alienated from this urgency.\n",

This study investigates factors that influenced academic performance amongstudents of Plateau State Polytechnic, Barkin Ladi, Nigeria. Primary and secondary data were obtained through the administering ofquestionnaires and the collection of student results from the school records. A sample of 363 final year students from the population of3860 final year students was selected using the Yamane sample size selection method. The data collected were analyzed using QuantileRegression with the help of R-Package Version 3.6.1. From the result obtained, different factors were identified at different quantile levelsto have a significant influence on students’ CGPA. At the higher quantile level (i.e. 75% and 95%), gender, number of siblings, mother’seducational level, father’s educational level, Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) score and how school fee is financed hadsignificant effects on student CGPA. At the lower quantile (i.e. 5% and 25%), the number of siblings, mother’s educational level, how schoolfee is financed, secondary school attended and UTME score had significant effects on student CGPA. Therefore, as the male students’results in the research seem to be lower than those of females, parents and schools should pay more attention to their education. Besides,the researcher recommends that government and schools provide support to children from large families.\n",

      "The rural boarding schools that were established in the socialist era to serve children in Mongolia’s herding communities remain integral to national policy for ensuring universal access to formal education. Education policy actors demonstrate commitment to the socialist legacy of the schooled herder child, while at the same posing legitimate questions as to boarding schools’ quality and contemporary relevance. This questioning is framed with reference to a globally-orientated discourse of standards, outcomes measurement and skills for employability. The paper argues from a post-socialist perspective that this orientation forecloses a nuanced, contextualised understanding of “relevance” as a complex educational policy problem. Drawing on policy documents and secondary literature, it develops and applies a post-socialist conceptual framework to explore the temporal and spatial orientations of rural boarding schools and their “relevance”. The analysis evidences multiple, intersecting layers of change which situate the schooled herder child and constitute Mongolia”s “unfinished business of socialism” in education. The paper concludes that the layering revealed in this analysis needs to be more visible to educational policy; and that to resist oversimplifying the complex problem of education”s relevance is an ontological imperative.\n",

      "Several researchers have warned in recent years about the need to teach children to think critically, creatively, cultivate emotional and social skills. Educators have an important regulation in the main emotions of their students. The primary objective was to improve learning by encouraging the acquisition of foundational awareness within the structured curriculum and by stimulating the development of practical and analytical reasoning abilities, resilience and commitment, in addition to technological, emotional, social, and creative skills. This study uses a descriptive-exploratory study which is part of a qualitative approach. Seven elementary school teachers were involved in this research as research subjects. Semi-structured interviews were used in data collection. Content analysis was chosen as the analytical method because it is very suitable to handle qualitative information. The results show a significant increase in the professional and personal growth of educators. Behavior, student-teacher relationships, and the overall atmosphere in the classroom reportedly improved, according to the teachers. They emphasized the need to include learning in emotional development in teacher preparation programs. It is clear that teachers need to receive more training as well as socio-emotional education in the educational process. It can be claimed that influencing the instructor has a domino effect on pupils, while also improving the learning and teaching process.\n",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic has completely changed the social life as we have known so far. Lockdown-type control measures resulted in numerous limitations in the operation of public and non-public institutions as well as limitations in social, family and cultural life. The measures taken due to COVID-19 have had an immediate effect on higher education in Poland. The aim of the study was to find out what experiences were gained by students participating in distance education in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic. The long-term study was conducted in two stages. The study included 290 participants who were studying in various types of universities in Poland. As a result of the research it was found that from the perspective of students, the biggest advantage of online education were logistical and organisational issues. The greatest limitations of online education were: absence of personal interaction with teachers and other students, difficulty in organising online classes based on students’ activity and learning-by-doing, lack of standardisation of platforms used for online education at the university, too much workload for students requiring independent learning, and risk of health problems as a consequence of too long work at the computer. In the second semester of distance education during the pandemic, there was an increase in student satisfaction with online education, mainly due to the more frequent conducting of synchronously classes The crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic situation initiated the educational revolution in Poland. It appears that online education will remain an integral part of Polish higher education system, but it will not replace stationary education after the pandemic.

      "Since 2011 Ethiopia has institutionalized teachers’ new School-Based Continuous Professional Development Program both at primary and secondary schools with the aim of improving the classroom practices of teachers and consequently improving students learning. However, different findings indicated that school based continuous professional development in Ethiopia schools is not achieving its intended mission. The rationale that has necessitated conducting this research is to evaluate English teachers’ implementation of the new school based continuous professional development in some selected high schools in Borena zone. To achieve this purpose, 25 out of 89 English teachers were purposefully included in the study. In addition, 4 department heads, 4 directors, 3 woreda supervisors and 3 education bureau heads were also included in the study with availability sampling method. Data were gathered through questionnaire, semi-structured interview, document analysis and focus group discussion. Close-ended questionnaire and focus group discussion were administered to the teachers. Data obtained from focus group discussion, here, was used to triangulate the quantitative data collected through questionnaire. Whereas; the semi-structured interview was conducted to school and education bureau administrators. For evaluating the portfolio activities undertaken, documents were analyzed. Data obtained from close–ended questionnaire were analyzed quantitatively using simple descriptive statistics and presented thematically and concurrently with data collected with other instruments, which were analyzed qualitatively. The findings indicated that although the teachers viewed the program positively as it improves their personal and professional development, they did not show much motivation to implement it effectively. In the first place, the finding revealed that there was absence of linkage between conducting continuous professional development and teachers’ career structure. This was further complemented by lack of subject matter and pedagogical materials, budget, internet service, class size, distance between teachers home and school and moral support to be made for the teachers. Besides, poor follow up from concerned bodies; inadequate awareness among teachers and other stakeholders on the program were also found to be impediments for the program implementation. Therefore, it was recommended that the regional and zone education bureau administrators should work collaboratively to organize sustainable awareness creating training for all the concerned bodies and provide the schools with necessary materials and internet service; make budget and moral support, and link the program with teachers’ career structure for better implementation of the program. Education bureau experts, mentors, supervisors and school leaders need to monitor, evaluate and provide timely feed back to the teachers’ portfolios to revitalize the program. Finally, teachers themselves have to view the program as part of their personal and professional development, and thus, implement it honestly and collaboratively.\\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n",

In this work, the authors argue that the countries’ educational system is skewed towards theoretical knowledge over and above practice. This is informed by the inability of education graduates to apply their knowledge to real-life issues in and outside schools. Irked by this anomaly, the study examined Dewey’s educational idea in order to ascertain the extent to which it can bridge the gap between theory and practice in the Nigerian educational system. The work adopted the descriptive research method. Findings from the study revealed among others that education, which according to Dewey should be child-centered, should be systematically provided in such a way that it constantly challenges the intellectual ability of the learner through experiments (practice) as this will help in creating a functional balance between theory and practice. Based on the outcome of the study, it was recommended among others that the Nigerian educational system should be geared more to learner-centeredness and the programme be provided in such a way that the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor abilities of the learners would be constantly challenged through information search, individual and group projects, and experiments.\n",

      "This paper reports results from a mixed-methods intervention conducted in partnership between a faculty member and an undergraduate to shape student study strategies for success in an introductory course. The instructor provided students with information on the effectiveness of the successive relearning study strategy, conducted an in-class demonstration of the strategy, and explained how students could apply the strategy to their study plan for the first exam. Students were asked about their planned study behaviors for the first exam before the intervention and exam and about their actual study behaviors for the exam after the intervention and exam. Students were asked before the intervention what an instructor could do to convince them to try a new strategy, and again after the intervention whether or not they adopted the new strategy and why. Quantitative results indicated that the intervention had no effect on students’ study behaviors, contrary to the predictions of the prior literature. Qualitative analyses suggested that students were open to learning more effective ways to study and thought that interventions like the one used in this investigation would convince them to try a new strategy. However, students were unable to use successive relearning because of procrastination and time management issues.\n",

Focusing on this difficulty, the study investigates the use of case-based method in the ‘teaching English to young learners’ (TEYL) course. For the study, case reports collected from different young learner classroom contexts are analyzed in the practice hours of the TEYL course to see if prospective language teachers can generate theory-informed resolutions for the situations presented in the cases. The cases are analyzed by the prospective teachers in three main aspects: the context, resolution, and thoughts. Prospective teachers’ analyses of the cases reveal that their resolutions are based on three main issues: theories/principles of child learning and language teaching, their language learning histories, and their beliefs. Studying cases from real teaching contexts reinforced prospective teachers’ thoughts in various ways, such as interpreting L1 influence better, how to treat young and very young children learning a foreign language, and understanding developmental sequences better. &nbsp;Further, views of the prospective teachers about the use of cases in the TEYL course show that they mostly benefit from those cases in various ways such as raising their awareness about the real situations in teaching contexts, guiding them when they experience similar situations, and providing different perspectives. Finally, implications of using case-based method in field courses for language teacher education are discussed.

      "In the fourth Industrial Revolution, ICT has witnessed the global burgeoning of a myriad approaches in teaching and learning in the 21st century classroom. The ever-changing digital age has witnessed a number of key players in the field of educational technology. Among them is the G Suite for Education, which offers a variety of tools to empower students and educators as they learn and innovate. One such tool is Google Classroom which recently got the nod from the Malaysian Ministry of Education as a teaching and learning tool in public schools. Amidst the excitement surrounding online learning tools, there are a number of teething problems that need addressing. The paper examines the issues and challenges encountered using Google Classroom as a teaching and learning tool among pre-service teachers in a private university in the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area, Malaysia. Data were collected from 61 respondents via a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The findings revealed that limited Wi-Fi connectivity, lack of training, class size and class learning time are some of the perceived concerns in employing Google Classroom in the teaching and learning process. The study recommends upgrading the current structure of Google Classroom to include chat features and mobile application development.\n",

      "This School Action Research was conducted against the background of low student learning outcomes. Observations show that only a small proportion of SMAN 1 Peukan Pidie teachers have implemented an active, creative, effective, and fun learning approach (PAKEM) in learning. The purpose of this study was to improve the competence of teachers at SMAN 1 Peukan Pidie. The formulation of the research problem is: How is the effectiveness of the training and guidance activities carried out by the principal on increasing teacher competence in the application of active, creative, effective, and fun learning (PAKEM) at SMAN 1 Peukan Pidie?. The research was conducted with an action research approach through three cycles. The results of the study concluded that (1) training in the form of workshops and guidance on the application of the PAKEM approach had increased the understanding (insight) and skills of SMAN 1 Peukan Pidie teachers about the importance of implementing the PAKEM approach in classroom learning; (2) The results of the analysis show that training activities in the form of workshops provide more knowledge for teachers about the workshop material itself, in this case the PAKEM approach, while the increase in teacher skills in implementing PAKEM in the classroom is mostly obtained through guidance activities in direct practice; and (3) Based on the results of the reflection, it is known that the competence of teachers increases through training and guidance on the application of PAKEM in learning.Keywords: Competence, PAKEM, Training, Guidance\n",

      "Emergency remote teaching (ERT) during the unprecedented global pandemic, COVID-19, identified the pressing need for innovative teaching methods that support and foster technology-enhanced active learning through the distance education paradigm. Distance education is not a new phenomenon, while the flipped classroom concept is also a well-researched method. However, there have been rather few studies about the flipped classroom (FC) approach in higher education with the support of technology. This study contributes by critically exploring how full-time distance students perceived the usefulness of the Technology-enhanced Flipped Classroom (TEFC) approach to support their graduate studies. A series of semi-structured interviews (n=7) collected the empirical data for this qualitative method of inquiry. Moreover, teaching materials were used for the data collection, while the interviews were preceded by a preliminary observational study in a TEFC in a STEM graduate-level course. Through thematic analysis, three major themes were identified that offered a broader insight into the students\\' perspectives concerning the benefits and challenges of the TEFC concept. The themes were sentimental involvement, technical FC design, and peer-communication. The primary finding revealed that the students perceived the discussion-based sessions in the TEFC to have enabled them to foster their knowledge transfer. It was also perceived as particularly positive in its ability to contribute to and influence the discussion flow. These validated earlier claims concerning a positive perception of the TEFC concept in the formal learning process. This research discovered that TEFC is a viable tool to support learning in a pandemic situation by empowering students and facilitating active learning through information and communication technologies (ICT).\n",

      "Assessment techniques in special education provide information on how teachers can evaluate learners with special educational needs to ease educational placement and instructional decisions. This paper aimed at investigating assessment techniques used by teachers in assessing learners with special educational needs in inclusive schools in the Volta Region of Ghana. The descriptive survey design was employed for the study. The study involved 80 teachers in all selected pilot inclusive schools in the region, which was the study\\'s target population. A questionnaire with closed-ended items was developed for data collection. Percentages and frequencies were used as statistical tools to analyse the research data generated from the questionnaire. The findings revealed that most teachers have insufficient knowledge and did not use appropriate assessment techniques in assessing learners with special educational needs in the schools. Based on the results, some recommendations were made for the Ghana Education Service through the Ministry of Education to organise in-service training and seminars for trained and untrained teachers on assessment techniques in special education.\n",

      "Actively engaging students with mark schemes has been shown to improve their subsequent assessment performance. However, such activities rely on a degree of tactic knowledge transfer which can be difficult for large cohorts or distance learning students. This case study considers whether online discussion around a generic task can help distance learners improve their assessment literacy. Distance learning students engaged in a task to design their own mark scheme and use it to mark a series of ‘mock papers’ designed to mimic a range of common marking situations e.g. fail, including irrelevant material, plagiarism. The marks of the first essay these students subsequently undertook did not significantly differ irrespective of whether they had participated in this task. However, the range of marks obtained by those that did not engage in the task was significantly more variable that by those who had engaged (F-variance test, p=0.0003), suggesting the task may help to bring consistency to the performance and expectations of students from a range of academic background. The views of students on this task were positive with three quarters agreeing that it had improved their understanding of mark schemes and over 60% (63%) confirming it would help them to grade their own work in the future. This case study illustrates that interactive campus-based tasks designed to improve student’s assessment literacy can be converted into e-learning sessions that enable the explicit exploration of tacit knowledge.\n",

      "The English language is in high global demand in political, economic, and social contexts, yet marginalized students living near the border of Northeastern Thailand are impeded toward upward socioeconomic mobility due to incompetence to communicate in English. Teachers, as frontline gatekeepers, should empower the students and help them attain academic achievement. In doing so, language teachers must be critically conscious of the untapped potential of marginalized students to acquire linguistic and cultural capitals through English literacy education. This paper aims to introduce critical pedagogy as an alternative for teaching English literacy to marginalized students in the borderland school context in the northeastern region of Thailand. Having reviewed related literature, conducted field visits to a school near the border of Laos in the Northeastern region of Thailand and had informal conversations with the teachers in the school in the area, the authors proposed three basic conditions that need to be considered in order to optimize the use of critical pedagogy. These are students’ family and community backgrounds, teachers’ experience, and institutional restrictions. Moreover, suggestions for implementing critical pedagogy in this specific contextare proposed: 1) deconstructing the oppression which students encounter; 2) transforming real-life experience into knowledge; and 3) negotiating between transformative theory and reality to accommodate difficulties in teaching English literacy.\n",

      "Students learn Bahasa Indonesia in universities, which helps them write scientific articles as a sort of academic scientific activity. Students are taught how to write scientific papers in a systematic manner, how to choose themes, the relationship between topics and content, and how to employ bahasa Indonesia rules in accordance with the PUEBI. However, students subjects do not correspond to the content, they are confined in stringing words, the resulting writing is not cohesive and coherent, and it does not follow Bahasa Indonesia norms. Using a blended learning strategy that incorporates creative problem solving, the research intends to aid the process of learning to write scientific articles and increase the quality of student writing. Descriptive approaches are used in the investigation. The findings revealed that incorporating technology into the learning process can boost students comprehension and creative thinking abilities. Students gain new skills in writing scientific papers through Bahasa Indonesia learning based on blended learning integrated creative problem solving. Students may quickly access the learning process, evaluations are conducted in a transparent manner, and time is saved. Using blended learning integrated creative problem solving to learn for students in higher education is particularly helpful in learning to write scientific articles.\n",

      "This article aims to identify and discuss the existence and strengthening of a child-centred teaching discourse in Zambian kindergartens. The article is based on the understanding that the teacher-directed approach to teaching is a historically based hegemonic discourse within Zambian kindergartens. This means that the teacher-directed teaching discourse dominates thinking in many ways and is translated into institutional arrangements (Hajer, 1995, in Svarstad, 2005, p. 243). Several studies have pointed to the challenges posed by the teacher-directed teaching discourse in kindergartens in Sub-Saharan Africa as a hindrance of pedagogical quality in such institutions, pointing to a child-centred teaching discourse as an important path towards development (EFA, 2015, p. 208, Temba, 2014, p. 110; Mwaura et al., 2008; 2011). This article includes a positive discourse analysis of the Zambian Education Curriculum Framework[1] and a small-scale qualitative study, based on observations from four classrooms in four kindergartens in the Copperbelt province of Zambia. The article focuses on conducting a positive discourse analysis of the elements of child-centred teaching discourse observed in one of the four classrooms. The findings point to the existence of a child-centred teaching discourse in the Zambian Education Curriculum Framework. However, only one of the four Zambian kindergarten teachers seemed to implement teaching practices that could be identified as a child-centred teaching discourse. The elements of a child-centred teaching discourse identified through the positive discourse analysis were: the kindergarten teachers’ professional decisions, good interaction with children, use of a variety of materials, and children’s participation. The findings are discussed in light of the Zambian Education Curriculum Framework as well as theoretical perspectives on child-centred teaching discourse, argumentation theory and children’s right to participation. Finally, the article includes a critical discussion of how the findings may strengthen a child-centred teaching discourse in Zambian kindergartens.\n",

      "The study aimed to explore the awareness of Arabic language teachers in Madinah toward action research, their experience, and the level of practices in professional development. The qualitative approach was adopted, and data collection included focus group method of (22) Arabic language teachers in (6) schools at the three phases of Education: Primary, intermediate, and secondary in the academic year 1439/1440H. A Semi-structured interview was prepared. In addition, examined the portfolio of teachers’ performance, and other written evidence. The Credibility, Dependability and Confirmability criteria for the study were provided. The analysis of qualitative data shows results that deal with three aspects: First, Awareness: As most of the teachers did not have any knowledge of the concepts of action research. Weakness of spelling and composition was the most important problem in teaching Arabic language, as administrative and supervisory barriers had also a significant impact in the absence of the action research practices. Teachers have optimistic expectations of its future production and the proposal of specific procedures for its broadcasting, the most important of which is: training and exchange of experiences. Second, the teachers’ experience: participants showed deep conviction of the importance of action research and the desire for professional development. Third, Level of application: the variance of the teachers in the implementation of some specific steps to address the problems of language without commitment to scientific methodology or documentation. In light of the results, the study recommended enriching the professional development plan for Arabic language teachers with integrated training programs on action research. The study also recommended further research for a case study of successful models for implementation action research and to explore teachers’ experience in various disciplines and their practice.\n",

      "The question of whether classroom reading activities in primary schools in England can be solely relied on to be sufficient for English as additional language (EAL) pupils to comprehend English text was the focus of the paper. Two case studies where Somali origin EAL pupils involved in learning English reading comprehension were utilized as a springboard to develop my argument that parents are an intrinsic part of developing pupils’ English comprehension as they may constitute financially less expensive and rich resources in terms of cultural experiences. Furthermore, England’s education policy regarding EAL pupils, reading for comprehension, and factors that influence it: vocabulary knowledge, teacher -students ratio in England school and parental involvement in schools were explored to provide an answer for the question of whether only reading for comprehension activities in the classroom is enough to promote the understanding of EAL Somali origin. It was argued that only those activities are not sufficient, and there is a need for the use of parents as resources to enrich the text input, which potentially increases the comprehension skills of Somali origin EAL pupils.\n",

Moreover, the Circular no. 4 of 2020 from the Minister of Education and culture who recommends that all activities in educational institutions must keep a distance and all material delivery will be delivered at their respective homes. This prompted researchers to examine the role of teachers in the learning process during the pandemic at SD Negeri 112268 Gunung Lonceng. The research method uses a qualitative approach by conducting interviews with classroom teachers with a predetermined sample. It turns out that in practice the supporting and inhibiting factors greatly affect online learning (in the network) but are no less important than the role of the teacher. Without a classroom teacher, the learning process will not run well. The role of the classroom teacher is very influential on the educational process at the elementary level. The role of the classroom teacher is very dominant as a motivator, administrator and evaluator. A teacher who has a duty as a classroom teacher must have professional competence so that an effective and efficient learning process can be created and can overcome student problems in learning.\n",

Culturally, many Chinese parents have held high expectations of their children\\'s early learning and academic success in later studies. Hence, a high-quality preschool service has become a contentious issue. The recent child abuse incidents involving various kindergarten teachers exposed by the media have increased parents and society\\'s concerns about the personal qualities and mental health of kindergarten teachers. Novice teachers are an important part of the kindergarten workforce as they are at the beginning of their careers. Their professional development level is a fundamentally important matter as it directly affects the reform and development of preschool education. The publication of a relevant preschool policy document not only emphasizes the importance of early childhood education, but also introduces new requirements for kindergarten teachers. Professional identity factors (Motivation, Self-Image, Self-efficacy, Task perception) and personality trait factors (extraversion, neuroticism, openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness) have been found in many research studies to be associated with kindergarten teachers\\' job involvement. However, research on professional identity, personality traits and job involvement of novice kindergarten teachers is an undeveloped research area in China. This study will explore the relationship between personality traits, professional identity, and job involvement of novice kindergarten teachers in Zhejiang Province, China.

Its results were based on a cross-sectional correlational research survey which was conducted online. The participants in the study were chosen at random from among 205 language teachers (n= 205) and 317 language students (n= 317) from various higher educational institutions in Asian countries. Results of the study of language teachers revealed that the respondents\\' pedagogical ideas and orientations were positive when it came to using technology-based teaching in their language classroom. Results of gender differences indicated that female language teachers showed a firmer belief in student-centered online language learning than their male counterparts. On the other hand, males are more likely than females to utilize technology in the language classroom, and their attitudes relating to it are more favorable than those of their female counterparts. The levels of language learning motivation and engagement among students were also investigated. The findings also showed a high level of language learning engagement among both male and female students. Furthermore, the test of relationship showed that the firmer the instructors\\' belief in the importance of student-centered teaching and the incorporation of technology in the language classroom, the more driven and engaged the students are in language learning. Students\\' motivation and involvement in online language learning are not related to their views about the significance of instructors in their life, which is contrary to what many people believe. When it comes to incorporating technology into language courses, there are several pedagogical assumptions that enable EFL teachers to do so effectively. More broadly stated, this study has implications for increasing language instructors\\' digital literacy to develop more motivating, productive, and engaging language courses for 21st-century learning to improve language students\\' digital literacy. https://doi.org/10.26803/ijlter.20.11.21\n",

Data sources included photo- elicitation interviews, participants’ diaries, photographs, and demographic questionnaires. Interview transcripts and diaries were analyzed utilizing open and axial coding. Photographs were analyzed using a reflexive approach combined with methods recognizing the contingency of visual meanings. Results indicated that the majority of formal conference sessions attended by TCs were activity/movement oriented and were selected based upon professor advice and learner interests. Prominent themes of their experience included future focused learning, relationship building, and breaking out of the comfort zone. Overall, conference attendance represents an impactful learning activity, one in which faculty play an important role in shaping TCs’ professional growth. Results indicate the importance of supporting TCs’ continual learning and development as they transition between phases of teacher socialization.Subscribe to TPE\n",

      "A well-designed curriculum creates a knowledge-rich one. The application of the Curriculum Design Coherence Model (CDC Model) in the international Knowledge-Rich School Project is discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Model as a design tool. It achieves coherence by connecting the three forms of subject knowledge: generalising concepts, materialised content and applied competencies. Concepts’ generalisability creates knowledge’s internal logic – the source of understanding (learning). Students only develop deep understanding when they work with generalising concepts. Thinking (learning) doesn’t occur in a vacuum – one must think with something (concepts). And students also need to think about something (content). The article explains why it is essential to connect concepts and content. Such connection overcomes the limitations of both a ‘big ideas’ or concepts-only approach and a content-list approach. The CDC Model’s connection of generalising concepts, materialised content and applied competencies also reveals why New Zealand’s current competency-centred curriculum is inadequate. Two examples show how the CDC Model is used – a Physical Education topic ‘Exercise’ and a Social Studies topic, ‘The History of Ngati Kuri.’ Topics designed in the Knowledge-Rich School Project are mentioned.\n",

      "This study investigates teachers’ second time development of ESP materials in the context of ESP curriculum reform in a Chinese university where a newly published series of textbooks are used. Data collected from classroom observations were analyzed to reveal teachers’ practice in the second time development of materials. Semi-structured interviews with ESP teachers were conducted to disclose the hidden agendas of teachers by a thorough thematic analysis. Results show that teachers’ second time development techniques mainly include omitting the “Researching Task” part, supplementing more “critical thinking” tasks, glancing through the “Reading Strategies” and simplifying the interpretation of discipline-related content. More advanced development strategies such as adding more discipline-related knowledge, changing the instructional sequence, reconstructing or creating certain contents are seldom used. The overall second time development practice indicates that teachers would rather simplify the teaching process than make it meaningful. Inability, laziness, the lack of awareness, and fear of making mistakes are the main causes of teachers’ rudimentary development practice. This study then suggests that institutions and teacher educators should offer special programs that can improve teachers’ skills in the second time development of teaching materials, take measures to enhance ESP teachers’ disciplinary/content knowledge, and enforce rigorous management so as to make the second development of ESP materials more effective and thus improve the quality and efficiency of ESP teaching and learning.\n",

      "ABSTRACTCurrent studies report that a teaching practice program is important for pre-service teachers of English in providing real teaching experiences at school. However, since the Covid-19 outbreak, all school activities are transferred to online delivery mode, which led to teaching practice implementation to be conducted online. This transference must cause pre-service teachers to have different teaching practice experiences. Therefore, the study aims to discover pre-service teachers\\' perceptions regarding their teaching practice experience during the pandemic. This research was conducted to 114 seventh-semester students of the English Education Department of FKIP Pontianak. The methodology was a mixed-method where the quantitative procedure was first done, followed by the qualitative procedure. The data were gathered through questionnaires and interviews. The results indicated that the online teaching practice program brought various experiences resulting in “satisfying” and “unsatisfying” perceptions. In detail, more than 50% of participants agreed that despite the challenging situations they faced during the practice, they found the online teaching practice program beneficial, especially in providing broad teaching insights and experience. Hence, despite limitations to its ways of implementation, teaching practice program tends to shape positive teaching mindset and attitudes for pre-service teachers. ABSTRAKStudi saat ini melaporkan bahwa program praktik mengajar penting bagi calon guru Bahasa Inggris dalam memberikan pengalaman mengajar yang nyata di sekolah. Namun, sejak merebaknya wabah Covid-19, seluruh kegiatan sekolah dialihkan secara online, sehingga pelaksanaan praktik mengajar dilakukan secara online. Pemindahan ini harus menyebabkan para calon guru memiliki pengalaman praktik mengajar yang berbeda. Oleh karena itu, penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui persepsi calon guru tentang pengalaman praktik mengajar mereka selama pandemi. Penelitian ini dilakukan terhadap 114 mahasiswa semester tujuh pada Jurusan Pendidikan Bahasa Inggris FKIP Pontianak. Metodolog yang digunakan adalah metode penelitian campuran di mana prosedur kuantitatif dilakukan pertama kali, diikuti oleh prosedur kualitatif. Pengumpulan data dilakukan melalui kuesioner dan wawancara. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa program praktik mengajar online memberi berbagai pengalaman yang menghasilkan persepsi “memuaskan” atau “tidak memuaskan”. Secara rinci, lebih dari 50% peserta setuju bahwa meskipun menghadapi situasi menantang selama praktik, mereka menemukan program praktik mengajar online bermanfaat, terutama dalam memberikan wawasan dan pengalaman mengajar yang luas. Oleh karena itu, dapat disimpulkan bahwa terlepas dari cara pelaksanaannya, program praktik mengajar selalu membentuk pola pikir dan sikap mengajar yang positif kepada guru prajabatan.\n",

To address the research problem, I applied an unconventional approach to research by using auto/ethnography as a methodological referent within a multi-paradigmatic research design space. In so doing, I used the paradigms of interpretivism, criticalism, postmodernism, and integralism as data referents, which enabled me to capture the lived experiences of my professional lifeworld at different stages. Moreover, I used critical reflections on the experiences as a teacher, teacher educator, and researcher as epistemic techniques to explore, explain and construct meaning out of the perceptions, beliefs, and practices. Perhaps, engaging autobiographically as an approach to knowing deep-seated views and practices and critically reflecting on the embodied values of practices open new ways of being and becoming a transformative learner(s). This paper invites readers to reflect critically on their own deep-seated practices by using such unconventional approaches to research that would enable them to experience a paradigm shift in their thinking, believing, viewing, and doing. I believe that in doing so, practitioners as researchers, with their own embodied values of practice in their professional lives, can transform self/others by creating their own living-educational-theories.\n",

With regard to this, references have been made from relevant journal sources, and the initial search rarely indicate the existence of any prominent studies in the Asian or Southeast Asian region. Therefore, this study is necessary for understanding PL. A content analysis method was made on 32 of peer reviewed articles obtained from sources such as the Web of Science, SCOPUS and EBSCOhost between 2017-2021 in order to identify the concept of PL and its characteristics in education. Coding and thematic analysis of the articles were performed using ATLAS.ti software. The findings of the content analysis showed that Pedagogical Leadership (PL) can be classified into three main themes, namely the characteristics of PL, the catalyst to PL, as well as the impact of PL. Practically, these themes could form the basis of the construction of PL’s instruments for the process of validition and reliability tests in the future. The implications of this study indicate that PL needs more time to: (a) identify characteristics that can be distinguished from other types of educational leadership; (b) understand the catalystic factors to PL; and (c) explain the impact of PL on the achievement of school goals.\n",

The study focuses on how ESL teachers expose OL learners to reading in the classroom. The qualitative approach with a descriptive case study design was used for this study. Data were collected using non-participant classroom observation and semi-structured interviews with ESL teachers. The collected data were analysed by establishing themes and emerging categories. The study is informed by the principles of the multiliteracies pedagogy of the New London Group (NLG) (1999). The study established that ESL teachers were not exposing OL learners to reading sufficiently, because they were still entrapped in mono-modal teaching habits. The ESL teachers who participated in this study revealed that it was challenge to find appropriate reading materials to use in the classrooms. In addition, participants in this study also demonstrated the lack of broad conceptualisation of literacy that is aligned with the principles and components of the multiliteracies pedagogy. The premise of this paper is to suggest ways in which OL learners can be exposed effectively to reading in ESL classrooms. This study recommends that the principles of the multiliteracies pedagogy (overt instruction, situated practice, critical framing and transformed practices) ought to be introduced in ESL classrooms in Namibia. As a result, ESL teachers will be able to create learning experiences that enable learners to develop strategies to read in a new and unfamiliar manner.\n",

Students and teachers had to face new challenges they had not met before. The aim of the paper is to research how both, students and teachers perceive the online educational process, to identify advantages and disadvantages of online teaching, as well as to analyze and evaluate the quality of online teaching in comparison with the attendance form of education from both students’ and teachers’ perspective. In order to fulfill this purpose, we carried out two separate questionnaire surveys (among students and teachers at the Faculty of Economic Informatics at the University of Economics in Bratislava). Based on conclusions resulting from our research, we can affirm that both students and teachers prefer the attendance form of education rather than online teaching, students mainly because of need of socialization, personal contact with teachers and classmates, better and faster communication with teachers, and active class discussion. The attendance form of education eliminates technology related problems, such as outages of the Internet, electricity, missing technology equipment, and this form of education is performed on higher quality level in comparison with online education. Among the most frequently limitations of online education mentioned by teachers were anonymity of students, complexity of preparation of study materials, and cheating during exams and tests. There are also some advantages the online education offers, such as time savings, more effective, creative and flexible modern way of teaching, and recording lectures.\n",

It is noted that the emphasis on the use of professional standards in the existing conditions will lead to a decrease in the creative component of graduate training, and the lack of the possibility of real practice will lead to dogmatism and scholasticism. The high dynamics of technical and technological transformations and transformations of the economic sphere in the Russian Federation against the background of global challenges demonstrates the discrepancy between the paces of individual training of high-class professionals. According to the author, the problem is not the transition beyond the boundaries of habitual work; the main attention should be paid to the \\\"smart\\\" future. Complex technologies require significantly more time than before to master the profession. Domestic specialized education should certainly be linked to the spatial development of Russia, which has a huge territory and corresponding local-territorial specifics.

All statistical findings were considered significant at p≥0.05. Cronbach’s alpha reliability score of at least 7.0 was achieved within each set of variables considered. Of the eight SCL components assessed, the most highly rated were role of lecturers (3.99±0.7) and role of students (3.53±0.6) while the least rated were obstacles (2.91±0.9) and learning outcomes (2.95±1.1). Three major obstacles to SCL identified in the study include: “in ability to cover the syllabus using SCL approaches” (3.04±1.4); “lack of infrastructure for SCL in my school” (3.87±1.1) and; “lack of guidelines for the SCL approach in my school” (3.13±1.3). The study findings conclude that, despite the good perception of SCL in the college there are limitations to its full adoption. Therefore, it is recommended that online discussions, training of staff and provision of measures to ensure content coverage using SCL, provision of critical infrastructure and guidelines for SCL be prioritized by the management and other stakeholders.\n",

      "The present paper aims at the analysis of low quality education at primary level in public sector schools in Pakistan. Education is considered as the foundation of all type of development everywhere in the world. One of the functions of the educational institutions is to produce efficient and skillful education managers and teachers. Mainly it helps the financial, social and social existence of the country. This study thoroughly examined the primary education system in Pakistan. The critical examination revealed that primary education in Pakistan from its financial and management side was most neglected. The quality of education does not only depend on preparing individuals for the successive educational level but to equip them with the required basic life skills. The striking agenda at global level is to strengthen the quality of education at all educational levels specifically at the primary level. The present paper analyzed different indicators for low quality as absence of money related assets, auxiliary and administration issues, expanded dropout, poor approach usage, obsolete examination framework, wasteful correspondence, absence of expert advancement, absence of learning assets, absence of supervision, lack of co-ordination and curriculum issues to gauge the quality of education at primary level in Pakistan.\n",

      "In this rapidly transforming way of teaching, blended learning has become popular across all education levels as it integrates the advantages of traditional classroom activities with online digital media. In the context of teaching English as a foreign language, teachers need to adapt to the use of technology in their teaching activities so that the learning objectives can be achieved successfully. This paper describes the implementation of blended learning in the Engagement Reading class conducted in the English Language Education Department of Universitas Nasional Karangturi. To get the data, the researcher conducted observation, interview, and documentation. The result of the study shows that the stages of building knowledge of the field, modeling of the text, joint construction of the text, and independent construction of the text are applied in the reading class. To facilitate the teaching and learning process, Google Classroom, WhatsApp, Zoom, Mozilla Firefox, and Chrome are utilised. At the end of the course, the students have positive perception toward the implementation of blended learning in the reading class. This is because they feel that the use of technology in blended learning facilitates communication and interaction, engagement, and collaboration.

      "Participation in physical activity, Physical Education (PE) and sport has been recognised as a powerful learning tool for education, providing a universal language for contributing to valuable life principles. Values-based education implies that learners are educated about the aspects determining their behaviour. Values-based PE, physical activities and sport have the potential to transcend diversity and achieve cohesion, promote tolerance and trust and affirm respect between individuals and communities. The goal of PE can be to contribute to the acceptance of the infinite qualities of South Africa’s diversity and to claim the country’s diversity as a source of strength that forms a bond of a common set of values. There has been a global change in the interaction of learners with their environment; their lives are shaped by forces that do not necessarily assist them to learn and apply values. A PE programme infused with the values of Olympism and Ubuntuism can offer an investment in individual and societal improvement as the co-evolutionary interaction of these values and how they affect each learner can add to the celebration of human diversity. The question this study set out to answer was how can PE be used as a tool to teach values. Thus, the study aimed to inform the development of a values-based PE programme for the intermediate schooling phase. This qualitative study, from a constructivist paradigm, has enhanced the understanding of individuals’ cultures, beliefs and values, human experiences and situations. Purposeful sampling, of 10 intermediate phase teachers from five different public primary schools sought information-rich cases. The theoretical perspectives of the experiential learning theory were applied to teaching PE during in-service PE teacher training workshops. The process was documented by collecting data from multiple sources. Participatory action research was used, determining how data were collected, analysed and presented on an ongoing, cyclical basis. This study developed material for the intermediate phase PE curriculum that underpins the values of Olympism and Ubuntuism as core values, which were modelled by teachers and guided their work. The PE programme included key elements of and aligned with the study aims of the subject Life Skills. The outcomes of using PE as a tool to teach values propose recommendations to the Department of Basic Education of South Africa, to improve and implement a quality PE curriculum that is applicable to practice and that will optimise the chances of meeting National Curriculum Statement standards. Further research is recommended on the rest of the intermediate phase PE curriculum over the entire year, which includes other movement phenomena infused with values.\n",

      "This paper studies the teaching abilities of physical education (P.E.) teachers in colleges and universities. First, an evaluation indicator system for the teaching abilities of P.E. teachers in colleges and universities was constructed using the Delphi method, and then the weights of indicators at each level were determined using the expert survey method, so that a standard scale was formed for the teaching ability evaluation system. After that, empirical analysis was performed on the evaluation indicator system. The research results show that the teaching ability evaluation indicator system for P.E. teachers in colleges and universities proposed in this paper can be used to give a quantitative analysis on teachers’ teaching abilities and clearly reflect their deficiencies in teaching. This will allow teachers to understand what to improve in their teaching so that their teaching abilities will be enhanced. This research provides theoretical and practical references for the evaluation of P.E. teachers’ teaching abilities in higher education institutions in China, and thus, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to promoting the reform of P.E. teaching in higher education and the professional development of teachers.\n",
